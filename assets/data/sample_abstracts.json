["A series of LaCr1-xMxO3 (M = Mg, Cu, Zn, Ni) ceramics was fabricated by a conventional sintering process in air and Ar gas. Relative density, electrical conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility were measured to investigate the electrical conduction mechanism of the doped LaCrO3 ceramic. The apparent density was improved up to 95% of theoretical density, especially in the cases of M = Cu2+ and Zn2+. The electrical conductivity (\u03c3) increased with increasing quantities of doped divalent cation (x), and log(\u03c3T) showed a linear relationship to (1/T). Magnetic data and chemical analysis indicated that the presence of Cr4+, rather than oxygen deficiencies, is preferential for the charge compensation. As a result, the electrical conduction was substantially governed by the hopping of small polarons between Cr3+ and Cr4+ ions. The substitution of Ni ions resulted in lower than expected unit cell volumes, somewhat different conductivities, and a different antiferromagnetic response, all of which pointed to the role of Ni3+ as of the source of an additional band conduction mechanism.", "Rietveld refinement of the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern confirms that Y2SrCu0.6Co1.4O6.5 is isostructural to Y2SrCuFeO6.5. Unlike its Fe-analog which is antiferromagnetic, Y2SrCu0.6Co1.4O6.5 behaves as a three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnet below TC=385 K with a spontaneous magnetic moment per formula unit of only \u03bcs=0.07 \u03bcB extrapolated to T=0 K. We concluded that this weak ferromagnetism (WFM) originates from Dzyaloshinsky\u2013Moriya (D\u2013M) spin canting mechanism based on the observation of T2 dependence of the low-temperature magnetization. The electrical resistance of sintered samples shows an exponential dependence on temperature exp(T0/T)\u03b1 with \u03b1=1/2 in the 185\u2013570 K temperature range, which indicates the conduction mechanism is within variable range hopping (VRH) regime with long-range Coulomb interaction between the carriers. Y2SrCu0.6Co1.4O6.5 does not show any significant magneto-resistance effect in the 200\u2013400 K temperature range.", "Heterogeneous films of CoCu having high giant magnetoresistance (MR) were prepared in the form of multilayered granular specimens by a two-target RF sputtering. MR performances of 11% at 293 K were obtained in as deposited granular films. The magnetic and magnetotransport properties could be changed to a large extent, by varying the thickness of the deposited Co (Cu) layer as well as the Ar pressure. The effect of Co concentration, in the range 5\u201330%, and the influence of thermal treatments were also analysed.", "The effects of Ta addition on the magnetic properties of permalloy thin films have been investigated. The alloy compositions on a weight basis are (Ni81Fe19)1-xTax with 0 \u2a7d x \u2a7d 0.105, and the films are sputtered onto a glass substrate at between room temperature and 300 \u2021C. The saturation magnetization and anisotropic magnetic field decrease with increasing Ta content. The saturation magnetization is 0.75 T at 5 wt % Ta. The coercivity remains constant at 125 Am-1. The electrical resistivity increases linearly with increasing Ta content, then saturates at approximately 7.5 wt% Ta. The saturation resistivity is approximately 1.00 \u039c\u03a9m. The magnetoresistivity ratio (\u03b4\u03f1/\u03f1) decreases with increasing Ta content, mainly due to increased electrical resistivity (\u03f1). The magnetostriction changes from negative to positive with increasing Ta content and reaches nearly zero at 2 wt% Ta. The NiFeTa films containing 5\u20136 wt% Ta have potential for use as the soft-biasing film in magnetoresistive elements.", "The spontaneous magnetization variation in the temperature range from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C was examined by correlation with thermal expansion measurement. Unaligned and aligned sintered specimens were examined to study the temperature dependencies of their dimensions resulting from spontaneous magnetostriction and thermal expansion. Above the Curie temperature (315 \u00b0C) all specimens showed the same normal thermal expansion, whilst below this temperature their thermal expansions were quite different and anomalous.", "The cathode fall region of the glow discharge contains fast electrons and fast ions which are accelerated in the electric field between the cathode and a plasma at near anode potential. When operated at low pressure and high voltage (i.e. on the left-hand branch of the Paschen breakdown curve), the fast electrons tend to form a mono-energetic group, although the ions, owing to relatively large cross-sections for interaction with the gas, have their energies spread over a wide range and also give rise to fast neutrals by charge exchange. Both types of particle can be efficiently brought out of the discharge through orifices placed in the electrodes. Thin or broad beams or sheets of particles, converging or diverging, can be designed over a wide range of current and voltage. At lower voltages, electron beams may be applied to a target placed within the discharge. As the voltage is increased, extracted electron beams become penetrating and can be manipulated magnetically outside the discharge. The gas pressure required for operation depends on the gas, the anode to cathode distance, and voltage and current. By appropriate design, operation at a pressure of about 100 \u03bcm or more can usually be arranged thus demanding only the simplest vacuum techniques.Both electron and ion beams may be applied to insulating materials as well as conducting materials. This is possible because electrical charging difficulties are avoided owing to the associated presence of ionised gas. A number of different types of glow discharge gun of novel design have been constructed and their characteristics investigated. This paper discusses the design principles employed and illustrates applications in the fields of crystal growing, vapour deposition, welding, thermal milling and etching and milling by sputtering.", "Polycrystalline ferroelectric Bi4Ti3O12 ceramics have been prepared by the method of reactive liquid phase sintering. The sintering behaviour of the Bi2O3-TiO2 composite was examined by plotting the isothermal densification curves. The results indicate that the starting oxides are involved in the reaction even at temperatures lower than or equal to 800\u00b0C, but the reaction advances at a very slow rate. Above solidus, the liquid phase promotes an extended reaction. Saturation observed in two densification curves, at 875 and 1100\u00b0C demonstrate that the reaction proceeds by two steps. A completion of the Bi4Ti3O12 formation occurs after 60 min of sintering at 1100\u00b0C. Optical micrographs of sintered bismuth titanate ceramics show randomly oriented ferroelectric grains separated by a paraelectric intergranular layer. The Bi4Ti3O12 crystallites exhibit a platelike morphology, similar in the appearance to mica, as evidenced by scanning electron micrographs. Isothermal annealing (750 to 950\u00b0C) does not affect the microstructure and electric properties of sintered bismuth titanate. The considerable value of dielectric permittivity and the appearance of hysteresis have been correlated to the presence of oxygen vacancies within the pseudotetragonal structure of Bi4Ti3O12. The oxygen vacancies are preferentially sited in the vicinity of bismuth ions as evidenced by X-ray photoemission data. XPS and AES measurements confirm that the surface concentration of cations comprising the Bi4Ti3O12 ceramics does not deviate from the nominal bulk composition.", "We study the effect of the substrate temperature and the temperature and conditions of thermomagnetic treatment on the magnetic and electrical properties of Fe10Ni90 films deposited on single-crystal silicon substrates by ion-beam sputtering. The laws found to govern these properties are associated with the transformations of the microstructure of the films. The maximum magnetoresistance ratio is shown to occur in films deposited on slightly heated substrates and vacuum-annealed at about 500\u2021C. The coercive force, anisotropy field in the plane of the films, the density of bonds at domain walls, and the magnetoresistance ratio are determined as functions of the thickness.", "Ceramic composites based on BaO-Fe2O3-B2O3 starting compositions have been prepared by the solid-state reaction technique. Basically the samples comprise crystalline particles due to the\u03b1-Fe2O3 phase. It is found that an easy control of the particle size and many of the physical properties of the system is possible by modifications of the composition and the sintering. At sintering temperatures below 1200\u00b0 C the material is essentially non-magnetic. However, it exhibits surprisingly large magnetization (small particle size and low coercive fields) at sintering temperatures above 1200\u00b0 C. The anomaly is explained by invoking a heat-induced Fe3+ \u21cc Fe2+ reduction and considering a modified distribution of the cations in the\u03b1-Fe2O3 precipitated particles. The results are consistent with microstructures and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of the samples.", "Bi-layer CoCrTa/Cr films were deposited on textured aluminium or textured NiP-plated aluminium substrate by d.c. magnetron sputtering. The crystal anisotropy and thereby magnetic properties depending on substrate material, substrate temperature and texturing, were investigated. The magnetic crystal anisotropy induced by the mechanical texture on aluminium or NiP/Al substrates along the texture lines for the film deposited at high temperature, were clearly observed, while the film deposited at low temperature shows less prominent anisotropic behaviour. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates a change in the preferred orientation of the chromium and CoCrTa films sputtered on different substrates at different temperatures. It was found that a high substrate temperature was beneficial to the formation of Cr(002) and therefore epitaxial growth of Co(11\u00af20) on Cr(002) for either aluminium or NiP/Al substrates.", "ConclusionsStrip with a porosity of 25%, when sintered at a temperature of 1200\u00b0C in hydrogen with a dewpoint of \u221230\u00b0C, is refined with respect to carbon and oxygen. At the lower sintering temperatures of 1000 and 1100\u00b0C, the carbon content is reduced to 0.03\u20130.02%; the quantity of not easily reducible oxides remains unaltered.With regard to the kinetics of grain growth, nonporous strip made from iron powder may be classed with steels which are coarse-grained by their prehistory.Porosity substantially affects the value of coercivity. Each 2% of pores increases the coercivity approximately by 0.1 oersted.If temperatures of 1200\u00b0C and above, with holding times of 2\u20133 hr are used for presintering, and temperatures of 900\u20131000\u00b0C for the final heat treatment of the nonporous strip, the magnetic properties of the strip can satisfy the requirements of GOST 3836-47 for low-carbon, electrical engineering thin sheet steel.", "ConclusionsA process has been developed for the production of nonporous sintered platinum-cobalt alloy specimens having a density of 15.1\u201315.2 g/cm3. A heat treatment schedule is proposed enabling the magnetic energy of such specimens to be increased to 34.2 kJ/m3.", "The production of consistent high purity materials is critical for improvement in performance and sensitivity of II-VI photovoltaic and photoconductive devices. Information regarding the energy band structure and impurity or defect levels present in the material is essential to understand and enhance the performance of current detectors along with the development of future novel devices. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is capable of providing information of purity, junction depths, dopant distribution, and stoichiometry in the material. SIMS techniques can achieve high detection sensitivities in very small analytical volumes and for a wide range of elements (almost the entire periodic table). SIMS analysis also provides unique capabilities for localizing atomic distribution in two and three dimensions. Ion images can be obtained by registering the positions of mass selected ions formed in the sputtering process. The combination of excellent detection sensitivity, high mass resolution, depth profiling capability, and high resolution image acquisition on a wide spectrum of elements by a SIMS instrument is not matched by any other instrumentation technique.", "MOCVD (metalorganic chemical vapor deposition) of GaN on both silicon and sapphire substrates was studied over the temperature range of 370 to 1050\u00b0 C. The crystallinity and surface morphology of the films varied with the deposition temperatures. By first depositing an AlN buffer layer, the crystallinity of GaN was improved for low temperature depositions, but little improvement in the surface morphology was observed. On sapphire (0001) substrates, epitaxial layers were produced at a deposition temperature as low as 500\u00b0 C. With silicon substrates, polycrystalline films were produced which were randomly oriented on the (111) plane and highly oriented on the (100) plane. The surfaces of the films were smooth and specular at low deposition temperatures, but degraded at higher temperatures. The energy band gaps of these films are in the vicinity of 3.4 eV, close to where they are expected. Elemental analysis by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) showed the films to be stoichiometric with low residual impurity concentrations.", "The low temperature sintering of MgCuZn ferrite was investigated using the usual ceramic method. The effect of Cu substitution on the properties of MgZn ferrites was also investigated and it was found that the densification of MgCuZn ferrite is dependent upon Cu concentration. The sintered ferrite with a density of 4.93 g/cm3 and electrical resistivity > 1011 \u03a9-cm was obtained for the ferrite with 12 mol% Cu at relatively low sintering temperature (910\u00b0 C). The magnetic properties of the ferrites also improved by the Cu substitution. The chip inductors made of the ferrite fired at 910 C with 12 mol% Cu exhibited higher d.c. resistance. From these studies it is concluded that the good quality chip inductor can be obtained using the MgCuZn ferrites.", "The optical properties of CVD MoO3 films were studied by ellipsometry in the spectral range 280\u2013820\u00a0nm. The films were deposited on silicon substrates by pyrolytic decomposition at atmospheric pressure of Mo(CO)6 at 150 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C. To optimize the film structure, annealing was performed at temperatures of 300 and 400\u00a0\u00b0C. The refractive index for as-deposited MoO3 films varies within 1.8\u20132.2 and the optical band gap energies in the range 2.87\u20132.98\u00a0eV. After annealing, the latter values slightly increase to 2.85\u20133.05\u00a0eV, depending on the annealing temperature. The band gap energies are typical for a polycrystalline material. Peaks in the spectral dependence of the absorption coefficient were observed. Their position and intensity are found to be affected by the process temperature.", "LiFePO4/C composites were synthesized by pyrolysis of LiFePO4/polypyrrole (PPy), which was obtained by an in situ chemical polymerization involving pyrrole monomer and hydrothermal synthesis LiFePO4. All samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge techniques. The results showed the LiFePO4/C sintered at 800\u00a0\u00b0C containing 2.8\u00a0wt.% carbon exhibited a higher discharge capacity of 49.6\u00a0mAh\u00b7g\u22121 at 0.1\u00a0C, and bare LiFePO4 only delivered 11.6\u00a0mAh\u00b7g\u22121 in 2\u00a0M LiNO3 aqueous electrolyte. The possible reason for the improvement of electrochemical performance was discussed and could be attributed to the formation of aromatic compounds during the carbonization of PPy.", "Typical magnetically functionalized Al2O3/Ni nanocomposite materials were fabricated by pulse electric current sintering process. The rapid densification and various microstructures were accomplished with controlling PECS temperature. The PECSed Al2O3/Ni system exhibited peculiar mechanical and magnetic properties with microstructure developments. The mechanical properties of Al2O3/Ni nanocomposite were optimized as controlling microstructures, and fine metal dispersion into the Al2O3 matrix give to the various ferromagnetic properties.", "The structural, magnetic and transport properties of sputtered Fe/Si multilayers were studied. The analyses of the data of the X-ray diffraction, resistance and magnetic measurements show that heavy atomic interdiffusion between Fe and Si occurs, resulting in multilayers of different complicated structures according to different sublayer thicknesses. The nominal Fe layers in the multilayers generally consist of Fe layers doped with Si, ferromagnetic Fe-Si silicide layers and nonmagnetic Fe-Si silicide interface layers, while the nominal Si spacers turn out to be Fe-Si compound layers with additional amorphous Si sublayers only under the condition either  for the series  or  for the series  multilayers. A strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling and negative magnetoresistance (MR) effect, about 1%, were observed only in multilayers with iron silicide spacers and disappeared when -Si layers appear in the spacers. The dependences of MR on  and on bilayer numbers N resemble the dependence of AFM coupling. The increase of MR ratio with increasing N is mainly attributed to the improvement of AFM coupling for multilayers with N. The  dependence of MR ratio is similar to that in metal/metal system with predominant bulk spin dependent scattering and is fitted by a phenomenological formula for GMR. At 77 K both the MR effect and saturation field  increase. All these facts suggest that the mechanisms of the AFM coupling and MR effect in sputtered Fe/Si multilayers are similar to those in metal/metal system.", "La0.7Ca0.3 \u2212 xNaxMnO3 \u00b1 \u03b3 (LCNM) solid solutions with x = 0, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10 have been synthesized (rhombohedral structure, sp. gr. R$$\n\\overline 3 \n$$c). Sodium volatility during sintering is shown to lead to the formation of vacancies on the lanthanum and oxygen sites. Ca2+ \u2192 Na+ substitution does not increase the fraction of Mn4+ in LCNM, but the increase in the concentration of lanthanum vacancies with increasing sodium content leads to an increase in ferromagnetic ordering temperature TC and magnetoresistance, which depend, in addition, on heat-treatment conditions on account of the sodium volatility.", "A major challenge in the field of selective synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is lack of established theoretical model for direct selection of metal/support catalyst to grow the corresponding SWCNTs. This has limited the application of these materials, especially, in electronics. In this report, we introduced circumferential and axial distortions in the Extended Tight Binding (ETB) equations to generate our model equations which correlated the numerical magnitude of chiral index (n, m) of SWCNTs directly with mass fractions of metal/support catalyst matrix, respectively. Theoretical predictions of our model equations showed acceptable deviations with ETB model, and two Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared according to this model to grow corresponding SWCNTs (10, 7) and (8, 8) via CVD pyrolysis of C6H14/N2 feedstock. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed bundled SWCNTs while analysis of their Raman profiles showed consistency with the radial breathing modes, diameter and energy band gaps of SWCNTs (10, 7) and (8, 8). Electrochemical analysis of the samples suggested potentials as pseudocapacitor electrodes. If fully explored and optimized, this model may complement or augment the existing in-situ epitaxial growth model.Graphical Abstract", "In this paper, we systematically investigated the effect of microwave sintering parameters on the characteristics of BaTiO3 capacitor materials co-doped with Y2O3/MgO species. It is observed that the granular structure of the materials is relatively insensitive to the sintering temperature and soaking time such that the BaTiO3 capacitor materials possessing X7R dielectric constant-temperature (K-T) characteristics can be obtained in a wide range of sintering conditions. TEM examinations reveal that the detailed microstructure of these materials is extremely complicated. The unique K-T properties of these materials are ascribed to the duplex structure of the samples, viz. fine grains of paraelectric phase and large grains of ferroelectric phase.", "Thin films of Pb(Mg1/3,Nb2/3)O3 (PMN) and Pb(Mg1/3,Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) were fabricated on Si and Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by MOCVD using ultrasonic nebulization and their characteristics were investigated. PMN-PT films deposited at 350\u2218C were annealed in a RTA (Rapid Thermal Annealing) system at 650\u2218C for 30 sec to improve the micostructural properties. The crystallographic properties of PMN-PT films strongly depend on the content ratio of PbTiO3. The content of pyrochlore phase in PMN-PT films decreased with the increase of Ti content and nearly single phase perovskite films were obtained at the composition of 80PMN-20PT. The PMN-PT films with perovskite phase showed a typical butterfly type C-V curve which verifies the ferroelectricity and had the relative dielectric constant of about 60.", "The important properties of lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have been investigated from Bismuth Sodium Lanthanum Titanate and Barium Titanate system: (1 \u2212 y)(Bi0.5Na0.5)(1 \u2212 1.5x)LaxTiO3(BNLT)\u2014yBaTiO3(BT) where x = 0.017 and y = 0 \u2212 0.2, respectively. The morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) was found to be around y = 0.1 by the x-ray diffraction and dielectric measurement at various amount of BT. The temperature dependence of dielectric constant (\u03b5r) at various value of y showed the diffuse phase transition exhibiting the relaxor type ferroelectrics. The degree of diffuseness increased at a high doping content of about y = 0.15 where the second phase transition (T2) of the ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase disappeared. Moreover, this sample had the maximum piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of about 112 pC/N with relatively low dielectric constant. The optimum sintering temperatures and the microstructures of the dense BNLT-BT ceramics were also examined.", "BiFeO3 was synthesized using a modified sol\u2013gel process, i.e., so-called Pechini method, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction pattern. Optimal conditions for the synthesis of single-phase BiFeO3 ceramics were obtained. This Pechini technique developed in this work is expected to be useful in synthesis of doped BiFeO3 or BiFeO3-based solid solution. Conventional sintering and spark plasma sintering processes were used to fabricate BiFeO3 ceramics. Ferroelectric and magnetic loops were measured at room temperature. The ceramic sample shows a stable dielectric constant and low loss tangent between 100\u00a0Hz and 10\u00a0MHz.", "An influence of compacting conditions on applied properties of the multiferroic PbFe1/2Nb1/2O3 (PFN) ceramics synthesized by the columbite method and powder calcination technique is presented in this work. The obtained specimens were subjected to X-ray and chemical composition homogeneity analyses, magnetic tests, electric direct current conductivity and electromechanical tests. Differences in the degree of diffuseness, densities and a grain size were observed depending on the sintering method. The dielectric and magnetic parameters as a function of temperature were measured. The tests confirmed that PFN powder compacting by a hot uniaxial pressing method had an advantageous influence on the crystalline structure ordering and the ceramics microstructure, what improves the applied properties of the material.", "The effect of dysprosium (Dy) doping on the structural and dielectric properties of barium titanate (BaTiO3) ceramic has been studied. Dysprosium-doped barium titanate (BT) with general formula Ba1-xDy2x/3TiO3 (x\u2009=\u20090.0\u20130.1) is prepared through solid state reaction route. The XRD pattern reports the single phase tetragonal structure up to x\u2009=\u20090.025 with space group of P4mm and a secondary phase is observed for higher concentration of Dy. The Raman study of Ba1-xDy2x/3TiO3 (x\u2009=\u20090.00, 0.01, 0.025) also reveals that the ceramic is showing tetragonal symmetry and with an increase in Dy doping the tetragonal phase is moving toward more symmetric phase i.e. cubic pm3m. The surface morphology of the sintered pellets shows a compact and homogeneous grain distribution with a decrease in grain size as the Dy content increases. The temperature and frequency dependency dielectric study of the ceramic compositions (x\u2009=\u20090.00, 0.01, 0.025) are studied to show the effect of Dy ion on the A site of BaTiO3 perovskite ceramic. The dielectric constant decreases with increase in Dy content. The dielectric diffusivity increases with increase in doping concentration. The P-E hysteresis loop confirms the ferroelectric behavior of the sample with decrease in remanent polarization and increase in coercive field.", "MnZn power ferrites with a composition of Mn0.681-xZn0.246Fe2.073CoxO4 were prepared by conventional ceramic technique. The samples were sintered in a computer-driven furnace at 1320\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then the influences of Co-substitution on the crystalline structure, microstructure and the magnetic properties of MnZn power ferrite were studied. It shows that Co-substitution has not changed the structure of MnZn ferrite, but improved the crystallization. With the increase of Co substitution content, Co2+ ions firstly replace Mn2+ ions and then replace Fe3+ ions. And at room temperature, the initial permeability increases with the increase of Co-substitution content. Co-substitution can also reduce the porosity and the power loss. In addition, the corresponding temperature of the minimum power loss shifts to a lower temperature.", "The effect of oxidation on dielectric-temperature behavior of core/shell grained BaTiO3 was studied in an attempt to reveal the prime governing parameter of dielectric-temperature behavior. BaTiO3 samples doped with 3\u00a0mol% Y2O3 or 3\u00a0mol% Dy2O3 with the same effective charges were sintered in a reducing atmosphere (Po2\u2009<\u200910\u221213) and oxidized at 1050\u20131250\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0h in air. In the Y-doped samples, as the oxidation temperature increased, the fraction of the grains with ferroelectric domains in the shell increased from 18 to 54\u00a0% and the residual strain decreased. With an increased domain fraction, the dielectric-temperature behavior became poor, and a dielectric peak appeared. On the other hand, all the Dy-doped and air-annealed samples exhibited relatively high fractions of grains with ferroelectric domains in the shell, 32\u00a0% at 1050\u00a0\u00b0C and 63\u00a0% at 1250\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating a considerable reduction of residual strain in all the samples. The temperature stability of the Dy-doped samples was poor, and there was a dielectric peak, irrespective of the oxidation temperature. This difference in dielectric response between the Y-doped and Dy-doped samples reveals that the prime factor governing the dielectric-temperature stability is the residual strain in the core/shell grains rather than the previously suggested factors of defect concentration, dopant concentration in the shell and the occupational sites of rare-earth dopants.", "low-\u03ba dielectric LTCC was developed, to realize successful co-firing with NiCuZn ferrite tapes. A critical high-temperature process in the production of highly integrated LTCC modules is the migration of silver from inner conductors into the LTCC glass phase. Intensive silver migration causes strong deformation of LTCC multilayers during firing in air. Silver migration into the LTCC glass phase depends on oxygen content of the sintering atmosphere and can be minimized by sintering in nitrogen atmosphere. However, partial decomposition of NiCuZn-ferrite and formation of cuprite was observed during sintering in nitrogen and, consequently, the permeability of the ferrite decreases. As shown by a combined XRD/thermogravimetric study the co-firing of LTCC modules with silver metallization and integrated ferrite layer demands precise adjustment of oxygen partial pressure.", "The effect of SrTiO3 addition on the microstructure and magnetic properties of yttrium iron garnet prepared by a conventional ceramic method was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, vibrating sample magnetometry, and ferrimagnetic resonance experiments. A YIG specimen sintered at 1693\u00a0K with 0.2\u00a0mol% SrTiO3 addition showed above 98% densification of theoretical density without changing in magnetic properties of YIG. A YIG specimen sintered at 1693\u00a0K with 0.2\u00a0mol% SrTiO3 showed ferrimagnetic resonance linewidth \u0394H of about 80\u00a0Oe.", "The microstructure, piezoelectric and dielectric properties of piezoelectric ceramics (Bi1/2Na1/2)0.94Ba0.06TiO3+xwt%MnCO3 (BNBT6\u2013xMn) with x ranging from 0 to 1.5 were studied. X-ray diffraction patterns showed the samples exhibited perovskite structure and Mn additive turned the structure from tetragonal phase to rhombohedral phase. The results of SEM indicated the Mn additive promoted the sintering which was beneficial to the synthesis of the perovskite. With the amount of Mn additive up to 0.1\u00a0wt.%, the value of d33, kp ,and \u03b5 were improved; While Qm also was increased until 0.8\u00a0wt%. The Mn additive acted on the \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d function simultaneously; When the amount of Mn additive more than 0.8\u00a0wt%, the performance drops.", "LaNiO3 (LNO) film grown at room temperature (RT) by RF magnetron sputtering is used as the electrode for integrating LaNiO3/PbZr0.4Ti0.6O3/LaNiO3 (LNO/PZT/LNO) capacitor on SrTiO3 (STO) substrate. For comparison, LNO film grown at 250\u00a0\u00b0C is also used as the electrode of PZT capacitor. Reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique is used to characterize the LNO film, it is found that LNO film prepared at 250\u00a0\u00b0C is epitaxial although no diffraction pattern is found for RT as-grown LNO. Ferroelectric properties of PZT films strongly depend on the LNO bottom electrodes. The remanent polarization (Pr) and coercive voltage (Vc), measured at 5\u00a0V, for the capacitors with LNO bottom electrodes prepared at RT and 250\u00a0\u00b0C, are 20 and 37\u00a0\u03bcC/cm2, 1.67 and 1.95\u00a0V, respectively. No obvious degradation of polarization for PZT capacitors with RT as-grown LNO electrodes can be found. Room temperature as-grown LNO as both bottom and top electrodes to fabricate ferroelectric capacitors can save 2/3 thermal budgets, which may pay a way to decrease the potential challenges of devices resulting from the oxidation, interdiffusion or reactions during integrating ferroelectric capacitors with Si technologies.", "Polycrystalline samples of Pb[(1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0x)(Zr1/2Ti1/2)\u00a0\u2212\u00a0x(Zn1/3Ta2/3)]O3, where x\u00a0=\u00a00.1\u20130.5 were prepared by the columbite and wolframite methods. The crystal structure, microstructure, and dielectric properties of the sintered ceramics were investigated as a function of composition via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dielectric spectroscopy. The results indicated that the presence of Pb(Zn1/3Ta2/3)O3 (PZnTa) in the solid solution decreased the structural stability of overall perovskite phase. A transition from tetragonal to pseudo-cubic symmetry was observed as the PZnTa content increased and a co-existence of tetragonal and pseudo-cubic phases was observed at a composition close to x\u00a0=\u00a00.1. Examination of the dielectric spectra indicated that PZT\u2013PZnTa exhibited an extremely high relative permittivity at the MPB composition.

High density (>99.5%) bulk nanocrystalline material was achieved after sintering at a temperature of 280\u00a0\u00b0C with a pressure of 500\u00a0MPa. Microstructure analysis shows that the consolidated bulk material exhibits a single phase with hexagonal close packed structure and a fine grain microstructure with a mean grain size of about 15\u00a0nm. The structural transformation from hexagonal condensed packed to face centered cubic was not observed, and the second-order magnetic transition remained in the nanocrystalline Gd sample. The Curie temperature of the nanocrystalline Gd decreased by more than 10.7\u00a0K below that of the coarse-grained.

The samples were prepared by the solid-state reaction at 1250\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The content and location of Vanadium in these ferrites allow us to determine its influence on their microstructure and magnetic properties. A single cubic spinel phase with lattice parameter variation was determined by the refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns. This refinement was achieved using the Rietveld method. The lattice parameter presents a slight enhancement with increasing Vanadium content up to 0.50\u00a0wt% of V2O3. The increase of intragrain porosity and the segregation of Vanadium at the grain boundary in samples with higher concentration of Vanadium show a narrow grain-size distribution that leads to a resonant character of the magnetic domain wall. A wide grain-size distribution determined in lower concentration of Vanadium results in a mixed resonant-relaxation dispersion. The use of V2O3 as a dopant in Ni\u2013Zn ferrites increases the frequency operation and coercivity, Hc, without abruptly degrading the saturation magnetization, Ms. We, therefore conclude, that Vanadium may be used as a strong dopant for the preparation of ferrites for any particular high-frequency application.", "Here, germanium (Ge) nanofilm as the high-capacity electrode was deposited on the three-dimensional porous nickel foam substrate by radio frequency sputtering. Then, cyclized-polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was coated on the surface of Ge nanofilm to get the excellent rate capability and cycle stability owing to the poor cycle life of the as-prepared Ge nanofilm. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were employed to analyze the microstructure and morphology of the Ge/cyclized-PAN electrodes.

The Sn concentration was varied from 1 to 12\u00a0% (atomic ratio). The influences of Sn-doping concentration on structure, raman, and photoelectric properties of the films were investigated in detail. The obtained films were monoclinic \u03b2-Ga2O3 homoepitaxial films. A decrease of about eight orders of magnitude in the film resistivity could be achieved through Sn doping.

A minimum out-of-plane saturation magnetization and a maximum out-of-plane coercivity were obtained for the Tbx(FeCoV)100\u2212x films near the point of compensation x\u00a0=\u00a023. As x\u00a0=\u00a023\u201345, perpendicular magnetization component could be observed, while the second largest saturation magnetization and a relatively low coercivity were obtained in the x\u00a0=\u00a040 sample. For the amorphous Tb40(FeCoV)60 films, with the increase of sputtering pressure or power, the out-of-plane saturation magnetization increases to a maximum and then decreases while the out-of-plane coercivity shows a monotonously decreasing trend as sputtering power is increased from 43 to 64\u00a0W.

The investigations performed on the two components, carbide and binder, reveal different oxidation behaviour in water, with a further effect on the properties of the sintered product. The decrease of the saturation magnetisation of the compacts corroborated with the microstructure reveals the oxidation of the samples milled for a longer duration.

The influence of substrate bias voltage on the chemical binding configuration, structural, electrical and optical properties was investigated. The unbiased films were amorphous in nature. As the substrate bias voltage increased to \u221250\u00a0V the films were transformed into polycrystalline. Further increase of substrate bias voltage to \u2212200\u00a0V the crystallinity of the films increased. Electrical characteristics of Al/Ta2O5/Si structured films deposited at different substrate bias voltages in the range from 0 to \u2212200\u00a0V were studied. The substrate bias voltage reduced the leakage current density and increased the dielectric constant. The optical transmittance of the films increased with the increase of substrate bias voltage. The unbiased films showed an optical band gap of 4.44\u00a0eV and the refractive index of 1.89. When the substrate bias voltage increased to \u2212200\u00a0V the optical band gap and refractive index increased to 4.50\u00a0eV and 2.14, respectively due to the improvement in the crystallinity and packing density of the films.

The dielectric characteristics were studied in the 100\u00a0kHz to 15\u00a0MHz. The dielectric constant changed higher with ferroelectric content increasing; and it was constant in this frequency range. The relation of dielectric constant with temperature was researched at 1, 10, 100\u00a0kHz. The Curie temperature would be higher with frequency increasing.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of pure and doped layered ceramics suggest the crystals are orthorhombic in phase. The room temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra reveal that that for lower percentage of doping manganese ions occupies Ti 4+ site with oxidation state Mn3+, while higher percentage of manganese ions doping leads to oxidation state Mn2+ in interlayer mixed (Na Li) site. In both cases the charge compensation mechanism should operate to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the lattice.

A red shift of the absorption edge from 2200\u00a0cm\u22121 (4.55\u00a0\u03bcm) to 1400\u00a0cm\u22121 (7.14\u00a0\u03bcm) with the film thickness was obtained, indicating that increasing the thickness is an effective method to expand the absorption range of the sputtered PbSeTeO quaternary thin films. The photoelectric sensitivity increased almost linearly with the film thickness. This is attributed to the decrease of the density of states (DOS) near the top of the valence band, the increase of DOS near the conduction band bottom and the narrowing of the optical band gap calculated by the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof exchange correlation functional formalism.", "High quality polycrystalline Zn0.98Cr0.02O thin films were deposited on glass substrates by RF magnetron sputtering technique. The effects of the gas-flow ratio of O2/Ar on the crystallographic structures and optical properties of the thin films were systemically studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), \nscanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence (PL) and ultraviolet\u2013visible transmittance measurements, respectively. XRD patterns show that all the films with hexagonal wurtzite structure have a preferred orientation with the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate plane. The results from SEM images reveal that the particle size of the Zn0.98Cr0.02O thin films firstly increases and then decreases with the increasing O2/Ar gas flow ratio. In addition, these films have a high optical transmittance in the visible light region. And it is found that the band gap can be enlarged with the O2/Ar gas flow ratio increasing. The PL measurements indicate that the intensity of the near band-edge emission increases gradually, whereas the intensity of the defect-level emission decreases with increasing O2/Ar gas flow ratio. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the O2/Ar ratios play a key role in controlling the stoichiometric and optical properties of the Zn0.98Cr0.02O thin films.", "In the present study, ZnO and Al:ZnO (AZO) thin films were prepared by reactive RF sputtering on quartz substrates at a constant oxygen partial pressure and a typical sputtering power. Films were annealed at different temperatures in argon ambient in the oven to study their various structural and optical properties. It was understood that introducing Al into ZnO structure would affect the ZnO crystalline structure noticeably. It was observed that annealing had great influence on various properties of thin films while ZnO film showed low crystallinity, Al doping into ZnO structure pronounced significant improvement in both crystallinity and particle sizes. It was found that crystal structures, average crystalline sizes, and topology of all thin films were modified enormously by post-annealing. It was shown that films transparency fluctuated by annealing, in which the transparency of AZO thin film annealed at 500\u00a0\u00b0C was much greater than others. Annealing led to decrease optical band gap of all annealed films from 3.31 to 3.26\u00a0eV for ZnO and 4 to 3.4\u00a0eV for AZO films. Photoluminescence manifested that blue emission in as-deposited film led to two different blue and violet emissions in all AZO and ZnO films. It was identified that the emission intensity of AZO film annealed at 500\u00a0\u00b0C was 12 times more than other ZnO and AZO films.", "ZBS glasses (0.125\u20132.0\u00a0wt%) composed of ZnO\u2013B2O3\u2013SiO2 were added into the LiZnTi (Li0.43Zn0.27Ti0.13Fe2.17O4) ferrites to achieve low temperature sintering. Variations in microstructure, bulk density and ferromagnetic properties of the ferrites along with the changes of ZBS glasses concentration were discussed and analyzed in detail. Results suggest that LiZnTi ferrites mixed with appropriate amount of ZBS glass possess high saturation magnetization intensity, low coercivity, and low ferromagnetic resonance line width. Although this sintering process was completed at a low temperature (~900\u00a0\u00b0C), the ferrites still kept relatively good magnetic properties. Thus, the ZBS glass is a promising additive for low temperature sintering of LiZnTi ferrites.", "M-plane ($$ 1\\bar{1}00 $$11\u00af00) GaN-based LED grown on LiAlO2 (100) substrate have been prepared by metal organic chemical vapor deposition. X-ray diffraction shows that FWHM for the m-plane GaN-based LED wafers on LiAlO2 (100) substrate is 0.237\u00b0. There exhibits small red shift (2\u00a0cm\u22121) for the E2 mode of GaN as shown in the Raman spectrum, the epitaxial GaN film was under a slight compressive stress as the value of 0.46\u00a0GPa, which indicates the as-grown epilayers on LiAlO2 (100) are almost fully relaxed. The optical band gap of m-plane GaN based LED was also investigated by measuring the absorption spectrum, which was calculated to be 3.419\u00a0eV. In addition, Excitonic absorption spectrum was observed in absorption spectra. A photoluminescence peak at approximately 440\u00a0nm is identified at room temperature. A strong and sharp electroluminescence peak observed at 480\u00a0nm is obtained at an injection current of 20\u00a0mA. The experimental results prove that high-quality nonpolar m-plane GaN-based LED could be obtained on LiAlO2 (100) substrates.", "The Sr0.6Ba0.4Nb2O6 ceramics with BaCu(B2O5) (abbreviated as BCB) additive have been prepared via the solid state reaction route. The effects of BCB content on the sintering behavior, crystal structure, microstructure, dielectric property and energy storage property of Sr0.6Ba0.4Nb2O6 ceramics have also been investigated. XRD results show that Sr0.6Ba0.4Nb2O6 ceramics adopt the tetragonal tungsten bronze structure and the secondary phase SrB2O4 emerges when BCB content exceeds 4\u00a0wt%. SEM results reveal that the addition of BCB lowers the sintering temperature and improves the densification and microstructure of the Sr0.6Ba0.4Nb2O6 ceramics. An analysis of the dielectric and ferroelectric properties indicates that the values of dielectric constant and saturation polarization decrease with the increase of BCB additive. The breakdown strength (BDS) is notably improved due to the reduction of the grain size and dense uniform microstructure. And the highest BDS of 187\u00a0kV/cm can be achieved for the sample with 4\u00a0wt% BCB. Complex impedance spectra exhibit that the BDS is closely related to the activation energy of interface polarization. The sample with 4\u00a0wt% BCB addition possesses the maximum energy-storage density of 1.63\u00a0J/cm3, which is 1.9 times higher than that of pure Sr0.6Ba0.4Nb2O6 ceramics.

BaTiO3\u2013Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 and BiY2Fe5O12 phases were found to coexist in the composites which exhibit excellent electrical, magnetic and magnetoelectric properties. The magnetoelectric behavior is strongly dependent on the concentration of BiY2Fe5O12 and the dc magnetic field.

Using 2 and 3 dimensional atomic force microscope images the surface morphology of samples were studied. The effect of introducing Fe to Cu layer was clearly seen from nanoparticles\u2019 size. UV\u2013visible spectroscopy was applied to investigate the optical properties.

Band gap studies show that when Fe atoms added to Cu layer the amounts of band gap decreases in thicker layers.", "Nano-crystalline Titanium Nitride (TiN) thin films were deposited on glass substrates by reactive DC magnetron sputtering in the presence of a supported discharge (dc triode magnetron sputtering). A hot thermionic filament which was negatively biased is kept between the target and substrate, and was used to sustain the discharge at much lower pressures. The TiN films deposited at room temperature (RT) were annealed at different temperatures of 373, 473 and 573\u00a0K in a high vacuum for 1\u00a0h. The films were characterized for their morphological, structural, micro-structural, optical and electrical properties. RT deposited titanium to nitrogen ratio was found to be 1:1 which has been confirmed by EDAX. XRD studies showed that the as-deposited TiN thin film were amorphous in nature and transformed to a nano-crystalline structure with increasing annealing temperatures. The crystallite growth of TiN thin films started around 373\u00a0K onwards, and it became a face-centered cubic structure with a preferred orientation along the (111) plane. The band gap of TiN thin films was found to increase from 2.7 to 3.2\u00a0eV with an increase in the annealing temperature. The photoluminescence spectrum of TiN thin films indicates a broadening of emission wavelength in the visible region with a maximum emission peak around 360\u00a0nm. The electrical resistivity of TiN thin films was found to drop significantly from 1800 to 400\u00a0\u00b5\u03a9 cm with an increase in the annealing temperature. The AFM micrographs of annealed TiN thin films show uniform surface pattern associated with a large accumulation of fine grains. Through this work, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to achieve the required physical properties of TiN films at lower annealing temperatures by the supported discharge dc magnetron technique compared to other sputtering techniques.", "Magnetoplumbite-type (M-type) hexagonal strontium ferrite particles were synthesized by hydrothermal method as the materials. Then, the precursors were calcinated at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C for two different time (200 and 300\u00a0min). The phase composition, micro-morphology and magnetic properties of the particles were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer. At hydrothermal temperature ranging from 220 to 230\u00a0\u00b0C, the phase of M-type hexaferrites includes small amounts of impurities phases, such as \u03b1-Fe2O3.

We obtained fine-grained BaTiO3@YFeO3 composite magnetodielectric ceramics (grain size \u2264250\u00a0nm) with a tetragonal-phase BaTiO3 core and an orthorhombic-phase YFeO3 shell by means of sintering at a low temperature (1180\u2009\u00b0C) in air. The temperature coefficient of capacitance characteristic (TCC) of the BaTiO3@YFeO3 ceramics satisfied the X8R specification. As the YFeO3 content increased from 2.0 to 8.0\u00a0mol%, the room-temperature permittivity of the samples first increased and then decreased, and the maximum room-temperature permittivity was 2319 at 6.0\u00a0mol% YFeO3, and a low dielectric loss at room temperature (<0.020). The saturation magnetization (Ms) and remnant magnetization (Mr) increased as the YFeO3 content increased, reaching values of 2.74 and 1.75\u00a0emu/g, respectively, at 8.0\u00a0mol% YFeO3.

Its utilization in the visible range necessitates its energy gap be reduced and tunable. Here, this is achieved by doping ZnO thin films with copper via a co-sputtering technique, where the ZnO was radio-frequency sputtered and the copper was DC-sputtered. The copper concentration was controlled through the DC power applied to the copper target, where concentrations up to 51\u00a0at.% were attained indicating heavy doping. The resulting films exhibited large absorption in the visible range with a considerable red shift in the band gap approaching a value of 0.57\u00a0eV compared to pure ZnO.", "The single-crystalline of tin oxide (SnO$$_2$$2) nanowires (NWs) have been synthesized successfully via chemical vapour deposition and structurally characterized by using x-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The optical absorption of the SnO$$_2$$2 NWs were measured by spectrophotometer.

It is observed that the bandgap energy of the SnO$$_2$$2 NWs to be 3.68 eV, exhibiting a 80 meV blue shift from that of the bulk SnO$$_2$$2. In a subsequent ab initio electronic structure calculation, the effects of defects (e.g., O and Sn vacancies) on the nature and origin of absorption are investigated for the single-crystalline system. Electronic structure calculations suggest electronic doping to be more effective to stabilize the absorption and the dielectric function results are consistent with the experimental phenomenon.", "We investigated the effect of excessive alkali metals on sintering character, phase structure, dielectric, piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties in KNN-based ceramics thoroughly.

The structural phase of synthesized ceramic was found to be pure perovskite as observed from powder X-ray diffraction. FE-SEM micrographs revealed the formation of homogeneous microstructure with well defined grains. The excellent dielectric response with a high value of Curie temperature (in the range 305\u2013315\u00a0\u00b0C for all frequencies) and low dielectric loss (0.06\u00a0at high frequency of 2\u00a0MHz at room temperature) was observed.

The processing method involves two stages that proceed in the course of the growth process, the main one is originated by the non-equilibrium regime of the sputtering technique, and the second is the diffusion-redistribution of the intermediate Cu film towards the neighborhood ZnO layers aided by the nanocrystalline films character. The influence of applying an additional annealing stage to the arrays in N2 atmosphere at 250 and 350\u00a0\u00b0C by periods of 30\u00a0min were studied. The resistivity of the ZnO:Cu films can be varied from 0.0034 to 2.83 \u03a9-cm, corresponding to electron concentrations of 1.12\u2009\u00d7\u20091021 and 7.85\u2009\u00d7\u20091017\u00a0cm\u22123 with carrier mobility of 1.6 and 2.8\u00a0cm2/V\u00a0s.

Structural studies have been performed using X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Ac conductivity and dielectric constant as a function frequency and temperature are carried out. The replacement of Gd3+ ions as a rare earth element instead of Fe3+ ions affect directly on the electrical and magnetic properties. By increasing frequency, the conductivity increases because the pumping force of the applied frequency helps in transferring the charge carriers between the different conduction states. Introducing Gd ions into the samples reduce the magnetic moment owing to the decreasing Fe\u2013Fe interaction. The effective magnetic moment also decreases with increasing magnetic field intensity. The general trend of the data is the decrease in TC with increasing the rare earth ionic radius, i.e., the ferromagnetic coupling between the A and B-sites increases with the decrease of the ionic radius of the rare earth ions if it enters the spinel lattice as the result of a small probability.", "Magnetic properties of Ni/Ti multilayers, prepared by the DC triode sputtering method, have been studied by magnetic measurements. Both metal layers are crystalline with a (111) fiber structure when they are thicker than 20\u00a0\u00c5. The magnetization decreases with a decrease in Ni layer thickness tNi and the analysis of the results at 5\u00a0K indicates the presence of a dead Ni layer about 13 \u00c5 thick. The effective anisotropy Keff of Ni/Ti multilayers is obtained using a torque magnetometer. Spin-wave theory has been used to explain the temperature dependence of the magnetization.

Improvement in crystallinity on sintering was identified from increase in intensity of the XRD peaks and grain development in SEM micrographs. Saturation magnetization increased from 81.7\u00a0emu/g to 85.3\u00a0emu/g as the sintering temperature increased from 1100\u00a0\u2218C to 1300\u00a0\u2218C.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-dependent Raman, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements have been performed to clarify the interplay between the structure and magnetic properties of the CFAS films. The XRD results reveal that both the crystallization and chemical ordering of the CFAS films are enhanced by the increasing annealing temperature. From the Raman spectroscopy, the representative Raman-active modes associated with L21 phase can be observed. The Raman mode at 843 cm \u22121 shows a strong temperature-dependent behavior, which has an obvious increase in intensity with the increasing of the annealing temperature as well. On the other hand, the increasing saturation magnetization and decreasing coercivity of the CFAS films with the increasing annealing temperature can be found by using the SQUID measurements. These structural and magnetic results of the CFAS films demonstrate that the crystallization and chemical ordering take the dominating role in the magnetic property. However, the variation of the Raman mode suggests that the local lattice distortion associated with the L21 phase cannot be considered as the origin of the magnetic disordering.", "Sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets are some of the strongest magnetic materials showing magnetic properties. Blending addition is frequently performed in order to improve the magnetic properties of these materials.

Spin-wave theory was used to simulate the change of magnetization as a function of temperature for multilayers with different Fe thicknesses, in which several fundamental magnetic parameters were extracted. The Fe thickness dependence of magnetization shows a significant increase of Fe magnetic moment at small Fe thicknesses. Close to the interface, the Fe moment is found to be 2.9 \u03bcB, which is higher than the value reported in bulk Fe (2.2 \u03bcB). It is shown that the increase in Fe moment is mainly associated with the increase of the Fe\u2013Fe distance close to the interface due to the lattice mismatch between Fe and Au. First-principle calculations were performed as well and have supported the proposed scenario.", "In this work, Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles have been synthesized by coprecipitation, sol-gel and citrate-gel auto combustion wet chemical methods.

Double-layer composite was also prepared with various particle sizes of CoFe2O4 as a layer and graphene as another layer. The effect of these layers as matching and absorbing layer was studied. The degree of crystallinity of CoFe2O4 was increased with increase of sintering temperature. Microstructural study showed the evolution of particle size and shape subjected to sintering temperature. Arrhenius plot showed two stages of growth process with activation energy calculated at 26.85 and 83.091 kJ/mol. The critical size of single domain of this sample plotted from the coercivity against particle size was 63.44 nm. Single-layer composite with mixed particle size was not able to show good electromagnetic (EM)-wave absorption; however double-layer composite showed good return loss. The mechanism of the EM-wave absorption of double-layer composite was discussed in this paper.", "Transparent and conducting tin doped cadmium oxide thin films were obtained by mixing cadmium oxide and tin oxide precursor solutions by the sol\u2013gel method. Different tin contents in solution were studied: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10\u00a0at.%. The films were sintered at 550\u00a0\u00b0C and, after that, annealed in N2/H2 gas mixture, in order to decrease their resistivity. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that doping of tin diminishes the [111] light preferred orientation of films and provokes a decrease of the average crystallite size from 30 to 12\u00a0nm. Atomic force microscopy images revealed morphological changes with the addition of tin content. All the films showed a high transmission around 75\u00a0% in the 600\u00a0<\u00a0\u03bb\u00a0<\u00a01,700\u00a0nm range and a shift of the absorption edge towards the blue region as the tin concentration was increased. The cadmium oxide films doped with 1\u00a0at.% of tin showed the lowest resistivity of 5.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 \u03a9 cm and a band gap energy value of 2.7\u00a0eV. For their characteristics, these CdO:Sn films are good candidates as transparent conductive electrodes in CdS/CdTe and CdS/CIGS type solar cells.", "SrFe12O19 magnetic nanoparticles with hexagonal magnetoplumbite structure were synthesized by a modified polyacrylamide gel route and characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, and vibrating sample magnetometer. To obtain large squareness ratio of SrFe12O19, a certain amount of carbon particles were introduced to the precursor solution. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the carbon and sintering temperature accelerated hexagonal SrFe12O19 phase formation and not changed the hexagonal magnetoplumbite structure. The phase transformation process is closely correlated not only to the sintering temperature but also to the addition carbon particles. In the Fourier transform infrared spectra of SrFe12O19 sample, three obvious absorption peaks at 600, 550 and 439\u00a0cm\u22121 were observed. The carbon introducing to SrFe12O19 precursor solution improved the surface morphology and enhanced the squareness ratio value. The coercivity and squareness ratio of the hexagonal SrFe12O19 are closely correlated not only to the crystallite size but also to the dispersion of nanoparticles of SrFe12O19 sample.", "Fine powders of Ni0.4CuxZn0.6\u2212xFe2O4, where 0\u2264\u00a0x\u00a0\u22640.25, were prepared by sol\u2013gel auto-combustion method. A two-step sintering process and the traditional final-stage sintering process have been adopted to produce NiCuZn ferrite toroidal specimens. The densification, microstructure, and magnetic properties of the ferrites have been investigated. It has been found that the sample produced by a two-step sintering process has a higher sintered density than the sample produced by the traditional final-stage sintering process, and the former gives rise to a higher initial permeability, especially when x\u00a0=\u00a00.15. Both the two sintering processes have no impact on Curie temperature which is only dependent on Cu-substituted content. The two-step sintering process is an effective method to produce high-density ferrites with improved soft magnetic properties.Graphical Abstract", "La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-\u03b4 (LSCF) is a perovskite-type oxide that exhibits excellent mixed ionic\u2013electronic conducting properties and is a suitable cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells. This study investigates the microstructural, optical, mechanical, and electrical properties of an LSCF\u2013samarium-doped ceria (SDC) composite cathode. LSCF\u2013SDC composite cathode powders were prepared by mixing 50 wt% SDC electrolyte with LSCF cathode powders obtained by the rotary evaporation technique. The band gap of the prepared powders was determined via diffuse reflectance UV\u2013visible spectroscopy. The chemical composition, mechanical properties, and electrochemical properties of the sintered pellets were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, Vickers hardness, and impedance spectroscopy, respectively. X-ray diffraction and Rietveld analysis showed that phase purity was only 96%. Moreover, a small fraction of tetragonal phase impurity was observed on the LSCF powders. Impurities significantly affected the phase stability and microstructure of the LSCF\u2013SDC composite cathode. The addition of the SDC electrolyte enhanced the densification of the composite cathode, thereby improving mechanical properties. However, the addition of SDC exerted different effects on the DC electrical conductivity and area-specific resistance (ASR) of the composite cathode. At 800\u2009\u00b0C, the ASR value of the LSCF was only 2% that of the LSCF\u2013SDC composite cathode. Overall, the electrical properties of the LSCF\u2013SDC composite cathode are closely related to the crystal structure, purity, and microstructure of LSCF cathode powders.", "A combined study of the surface nanostructure and electrical characteristics of iron thin films prepared on naturally passivated silicon wafers is presented. By means of conductive-scanning force microscopy, the influence of the substrate temperature during film preparation on both surface morphology and conductivity response is investigated. In addition, magnetic properties of these films are reported and correlated with the nanostructural properties. Films prepared at 200\u00a0K show granular core\u2013shell magnetic behaviour exhibiting exchange bias. Both conductive and magnetic data indicate that samples prepared at low temperature behave as a percolated network of nanometric metallic iron clusters (with typical sizes of 20\u00a0nm) interconnected by oxidized chains (of 10\u00a0nm in diameter), showing an excellent system for nanotechnological exchange bias applications.", "The effect of compaction on the porosity and magnetic properties of materials sintered from iron powder is studied. It is shown that porosity, when it is more than 6.5%, is the major factor that determines the magnetic flux density of the material. With lower porosity, the magnetic properties are greatly influenced by another structural factor\u2014strain accumulated during additional compaction.", "The microstructure and magnetic properties of cobalt ferrite thin films deposited by the sputtering method on an Fe3O4 under-layer were investigated at different post-annealing temperatures. Results show that the Fe3O4 under-layer can accelerate the grain growth of cobalt ferrite films due to the phase transformation of the Fe3O4 under-layer at about 400\u00b0C\u2013500\u00b0C. By introducing the Fe3O4 under-layer, cobalt ferrite nanocrystalline thin films with high coercivity can be obtained at lower post-annealing temperatures.", "In this paper, the structure and magnetic properties of FeRh alloy thin films with a small amount of Pt doping fabricated onto a glass substrate by sputtering are investigated systematically. XRD results show that the diffraction pattern of as-deposited film exhibits only nonmagnetic \u03b3 phase. After annealing, the disordered \u03b3 phase transforms to an ordered \u03b1\u2032 phase. The temperature dependence of saturation magnetization of different annealing times and Pt contents are characterized. The phase transition temperature increases as the Pt component is increased, but the saturation magnetization reduces as the Pt component is increased. These results may be caused by the growth of the disordered \u03b3 phase.", "Spherical LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 was successfully prepared by controlled crystallization. The preparation started with the spherical coprecipitate of Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3CO3 from NiSO4, CoSO4, MnSO4, NH4HCO3, and NH3\u00b7H2O, followed by pyrolysis of Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3CO3 at 600\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h. The X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the homogeneous cubic (Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)3O4 was obtained after the pyrolysis. Spherical LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 was obtained by sintering of the mixture of as-obtained (Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)3O4 and LiOH\u00b7H2O at 900\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h in air. As-prepared spherical LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 presented initial discharge capacity of 162.9\u00a0mA h g\u22121 and capacity retention of 98% at 50th cycle.", "Fe\u2212Co composition gradient and Fe\u2212Pt multilayer alloy films were tested as catalysts for groving vertically aligned carbon nanofibers (VACNFs) by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The Fe\u2212Co film yielded nanofibers with alloy tips in a wide compositional range varying from 8.15 pct Fe at the Co-rich end to 46.29 pct Fe in the middle of the wafer as determined by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Two Fe\u2212Co cubic phases (SG Pm3m, \n$${\\text{P}}m\\overline 3 m$$\n were identified by preliminary X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Magnetic measurements showed a substantially greater hysteresis loop area and coercivity in Fe\u2212Co catalyst nanoparticles as compared to the asdeposited Fe\u2212Co film. The Fe\u2212Pt film did not break into FePt alloy nanoparticles under the applied processing parameters and thus the utility of FePt as a VACNF catalyst has been inconclusive.", "Rather than using conventional electromagnetic stirring (EMS) with three-phase alternating current, permanent magnet stirring (PMS), based on the use of sintered NdFeB material which has excellent magnetic characteristics, can be employed to generate a magnetic field for the stirring of liquid metal during solidification. Recent experience with steel casting indicates that PMS requires less than 20 pct of the total energy compared with EMS. Despite the excellent magnetic density properties and low power consumption, this relatively new technology has received comparatively little attention by the metal casting community. This paper reviews simulation modeling, experimental studies, and industrial trials of PMS conducted during recent years. With the development of magnetic simulation software, the magnetic field and associated flow patterns generated by PMS have been evaluated. Based on the results obtained from laboratory experiments, the effects of PMS on metal solidification structures and typical defects such as surface pinholes and center cavities are summarized. The significance of findings obtained from trials of PMS within the metals processing sector, including the continuous casting of steel, are discussed with the aim of providing an overview of the relevant parameters that are of importance for further development and industrial application of this innovative technology.", "Low dielectric constant materials as interlayer dielectrics (ILDs) offer a way to reduce the RC time delay in high-performance ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) circuits. Fluorocarbon films containing silicon have been developed for interlayer applications below 50-nm linewidth technology. The preparation of the films was carried out by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) using gas precursors of tetrafluorocarbon as the source of active species and disilane (5 vol.% in helium) as a reducing agent to control the ratio of F/C in the films. The basic properties of the low dielectric constant (low-k) interlayer dielectric films are studied as a function of the fabrication process parameters. The electrical, mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties were evaluated including dielectric constant, surface planarity, hardness, residual stress, chemical bond structure, and shrinkage upon heat treatments. The deposition process conditions were optimized for film thermal stability while maintaining a relative dielectric value as low as 2.0. The average breakdown field strength was 4.74 MV/cm. The optical energy gap was in the range 2.2\u20132.4 eV. The hardness and residual stress in the optimized processed SiCF films were, respectively, measured to be in the range 1.4\u20131.78 GPa and in the range 11.6\u201323.2 MPa of compressive stress.", "In this paper, a novel and simple sodium alginate (SA) gel method was developed to prepare \u03b3-NaxCo2O4. This method involved the chemical gelling of SA in the presence of Co2+ ions by cross-linking. After calcining at 700\u00b0C to 800\u00b0C, single-phase \u03b3-NaxCo2O4 crystals were obtained. The arrangement of about 1\u00a0\u03bcm to 4\u00a0\u03bcm flaky particles exhibited a well-tiled structure along the plane direction of the flaky particles. SA not only acted as the control agent for crystal growth, but also provided a Na source for the \u03b3-NaxCo2O4 crystals. The electrical properties of \u03b3-NaxCo2O4 ceramics prepared via ordinary sintering after cold isostatic pressing were investigated. The Seebeck coefficient and power factor of the bulk material were 177\u00a0\u03bcV\u00a0K\u22121 and 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22121\u00a0K\u22122 at 850\u00a0K, respectively.", "Pulsed laser deposition was used to produce thin films of zinc oxysulfide (ZnOxS1\u2212x) on quartz substrates. The target was a sintered pellet (ZnO0.39S0.61) made of a solution precipitate. The film composition obtained by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was ZnO0.41S0.59, ZnO0.44S0.56, and ZnO0.37S0.63 for substrate temperatures of 450\u00b0C, 540\u00b0C, and 630\u00b0C, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that samples deposited at 450\u00b0C and at 540\u00b0C had a prominent cubic sphalerite phase, whereas samples deposited at 630\u00b0C consisted of three phases, viz. hexagonal wurtzite and cubic sphalerite (ZnS), and hexagonal zincite (ZnO). With respect to the tabulated lattice spacings for sphalerite (cell constant 0.5406\u00a0nm), distinct shifts were observed for the low temperature samples, yielding cell constants around 0.533\u00a0nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\u2013selected area electron diffraction studies support the XRD data. Patterns of films deposited at 540\u00b0C could be indexed as sphalerite, with similar lattice shifts as in XRD, resulting in a cell constant of 0.53. Locally highly resolved chemical analysis by TEM\u2013energy dispersive x-ray analysis revealed a stoichiometry that was consistent with the EPMA results. Ultraviolet (UV)\u2013visible transmission measurements of the films led to bandgap energies around 3.3\u00a0eV, which is well below the reported bandgap energies of ZnS.", "The best films for thermoelectric applications near room temperature are based on the compounds Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3, and Bi2Se3, which as single crystals have distinct anisotropy in their electrical conductivity \u03c3 regarding the trigonal c-axis, whereas the Seebeck coefficient S is nearly isotropic. For p- and n-type alloys, P\u22a5c\u00a0>\u00a0P||c, and the power factors P\u22a5c of single crystals are always higher compared with polycrystalline films, where the power factor is defined as P\u00a0=\u00a0S2\u03c3, \u22a5c and ||c are the direction perpendicular and parallel to the c-axis, respectively. For the first time in sputter-deposited p-type (Bi0.15Sb0.85)2Te3 and n-type Bi2(Te0.9Se0.1)3 thin films, the anisotropy of the electrical conductivity has been measured directly as it depends on the angle \u03c6 between the electrical current and the preferential orientation of the polycrystals (texture) using a standard four-probe method. The graphs of \u03c3(\u03c6) show the expected behavior, which can be described by a weighted mixture of \u03c3\u22a5c and \u03c3||c contributions. Because (\u03c3\u22a5c/\u03c3||c)p\u00a0<\u00a0(\u03c3\u22a5c/\u03c3||c)n, the n-type films have stronger anisotropy than the p-type films. For this reason, the angular weighted contributions of P||c lead to a larger drop in the power factor of polycrystalline n-type films compared with p-type films.", "Thermoelectric properties of thick (~60\u00a0\u03bcm) films prepared by a screen-printing technique using p-type misfit-layered cobalt oxide Ca3Co4O9+\u03b4 with Ag addition have been studied. The screen-printed films were sintered in air at various temperatures ranging from 973\u00a0K to 1223\u00a0K. After each sintering process, crystal and microstructure analyses were carried out to determine the optimal sintering condition. The results show that the thermoelectric properties of pure Ca3Co4O9+\u03b4 thick film are comparable to those of cold isostatic pressing (CIP) samples. We found that the maximum power factor was improved by about 67% (to 0.3\u00a0mW/m\u00a0K2) for film with proper silver (Ag) metallic inclusions as compared with 0.18\u00a0mW/m\u00a0K2 for pure Ca3Co4O9+\u03b4 film under the same sintering condition of 1223\u00a0K for 2\u00a0h in air.", "Phase-pure multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) was prepared by the coprecipitation technique using diverse precursors bismuth oxide at temperature as low as 400\u00b0C.

Uniaxially pressed samples (\u00d88\u00a0mm) were sintered in air at 500\u00b0C to 800\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to determine the amorphous and perovskite nature of as-synthesized and calcined/sintered samples, respectively. The crystallite size of sintered powders increased from 47\u00a0nm to 67\u00a0nm. Scanning electron microscopy showed grain growth during sintering, which improved intergranular connectivity and decreased porosity in the samples. The ferroelectric to paraelectric Curie transition temperature (TC) of pure BFO powder was detected by differential scanning calorimetry analysis and found to be 820\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00b0C. The samples exhibited high AC resistivity and dielectric constant, and low loss tangent values. The samples exhibited weak ferromagnetic behavior with an unsaturated magnetization versus magnetic field hysteresis loop at room temperature. Ferroelectric behavior and variation in remnant polarization and coercivity were observed from polarization versus electric field loops. Enhanced capacitance in the magnetic field revealed the magnetoelectric effect in the samples.", "The thermoelectric properties of ternary Ti10Ru19B8 and quaternary Ti9TM2Ru18B8 (TM: Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) compounds were investigated in the temperature range from 373\u00a0K to 973\u00a0K. They form pseudogaps in the electronic densities of states near the Fermi level, EF, which is suitable for thermoelectric materials. We synthesized crack-free pellet samples using arc-melting followed by spark plasma sintering. A maximum dimensionless figure of merit zTmax was 0.09 at 973\u00a0K for Ti10Ru19B8 whereas a large power factor of 1.4 mW/m\u00a0K2 was obtained at that temperature. The phonon thermal conductivity decreased through TM substitutions; however, the power factor also decreased due to an additional electronic density of states originated from TM d-states around EF; that is, excitations of both holes and electrons.", "SrCO3/ZnO-codoped 0.9Pb1\u2212ySry[(Zr0.23Ti0.36)\u2013(Mg1/2W1/2)\u2013(Ni1/3Nb2/3)]O3\u20130.10\tNi0.8Co0.1Cu0.1Fe2O4\u00a0+\u00a0xZnO ceramics have been prepared via a solid-state reaction method.

The SPS technique was employed to prepare dense Ba0.9Sr0.1TiO3 nano-ceramics at different temperatures ranging from 800\u00b0C to 1000\u00b0C within a very short time. The SPS samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electrical, ferroelectric and piezoelectric property measurements. The dielectric constant both at room temperature and Curie temperature increased with increasing SPS temperature.

Red light-emitting phosphor is the key component to be integrated with the well-established blue light-emitting diode chips for stimulating natural sunlight. However, environmentally hazardous rare-earth (RE) dopants, e.g. Eu2+ and Ce2+, are commonly used for red-emitting phosphors. Mg2TiO4 inverse spinel has been reported as a promising matrix material for \u201cRE-free\u201d red light luminescent material.

Nitrogen gas (N2) at partial pressure of 0.3\u00a0Pa, 0.4\u00a0Pa, 0.5\u00a0Pa, and 0.6\u00a0Pa was used to prepare the TiN thin films, maintaining total pressure of argon and N2 of about 0.7\u00a0Pa. The chemical, microstructural, optical, and electrical properties of the TiN thin films were systematically studied. Presence of different phases of Ti with nitrogen (N), oxygen (O2), and carbon (C) elements was revealed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization. Increase in the nitrogen pressure from 0.3\u00a0Pa to 0.6\u00a0Pa reduced the optical bandgap of the TiN thin film from 2.9\u00a0eV to 2.7\u00a0eV. Photoluminescence study showed that TiN thin film deposited at N2 partial pressure of 0.3\u00a0Pa exhibited three shoulder peaks at 330\u00a0nm, 335\u00a0nm, and 340\u00a0nm, which disappeared when the sample was deposited with N2 partial pressure of 0.6\u00a0Pa.

Because of the presence of the liquid Bi2O3\u2013ZnO phase at the eutectic point of 738\u00b0C, the sintering temperature decreased from 1150\u00b0C to 1000\u00b0C, and the morphology phase boundary of BNKT\u2013xZnOn ceramics can be clarified by two separated peaks at (002)T and (200)T of 2\u03b8 in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The improvement of ferroelectric properties has been obtained for BNZT\u20130.2 wt.% ZnOn ceramics by the increase of remanent polarization up to 20.4 \u03bcC/cm2 and a decrease of electric coercive field down to 14.2\u00a0kV/cm. The piezoelectric parameters of the ceramic included a piezoelectric charge constant of d31\u00a0=\u00a078 pC/N; electromechanical coupling factors kp\u00a0=\u00a00.31 and kt\u00a0=\u00a00.34, larger than the values of 42 pC/N, 0.12 and 0.13, respectively, were obtained for the BNKT ceramics.", "Li2Pb2La2W2Ti4Nb4O30 complex ferroelectric oxide was prepared by using a high-temperature solid-state reaction method (calcination temperature, ~1100 \u00b0C and sintering temperature, ~1150 \u00b0C). Room temperature preliminary structural analysis shows formation of a single-phase compound. The nature of microstructure (i.e. grain distribution, presence of voids, grain size, etc) recorded using scanning electron microscope (SEM) clearly suggests the formation of high quality and density of pellet samples. Studies of temperature dependence of dielectric constant, tangent loss and polarization show the existence of ferroelectric phase transition in the material at high temperature (307 \u00b0C). Detailed studies of temperature dependence of electrical parameters (i.e. impedance (400\u2212475\u00a0\u00b0C), modulus, conductivity, etc) of the material clearly suggest a strong correlation between its microstructure (i.e. bulk, grain boundary, etc) and electrical properties. The nature of temperature variation of d.c. conductivity showed an Arrhenius behaviour of the material. A signature of ionic conductivity in the material was observed in its a.c. conductivity spectrum. The nature of frequency dependence of a.c. conductivity of the material can be explained by Jonscher\u2019s universal power law. Electrical transport properties of the material show existence of non-exponential type of conductivity relaxation.", "Tin oxide thin films were deposited on glass substrate with 100 nm thickness of Sn, which was coated by magnetron sputtering followed by thermal oxidation at different temperatures. The effect of oxidation temperature on the optical and structural properties of SnO2 films were investigated. Higher transmittance, lower absorption and lesser structural defects were obtained at higher temperatures. Optical bandgap increases with temperature, while the Urbach energy showed reduction. The X-ray diffraction studies showed that at lower temperatures (300, 350 \u00b0C), a combined phase of SnO and SnO2 was obtained, while at higher temperatures (400, 450 \u00b0C), a nearly polycrystalline SnO2 film with preferred orientation of (101) was produced. Annealing of the samples at 500\u2013650 \u00b0C caused the transmittance and optical bandgap increased, while the absorption decreased. Reduction of the Urbach energy after annealing could be attributed to the reduction of the degree of thermal disorder. AFM studies showed that although the thin films were annealed under similar condition, their roughness was not similar because of different oxidation temperatures, which means that initial oxidation temperature played an important role on surface uniformity of SnO2 thin films.", "The spin-wave excitations and the magnetism of Fe/Au multilayers with different Fe thicknesses (tFe) grown by RF sputtering were investigated. The temperature dependence of spontaneous magnetization is well described by a T3/2 law in all multilayers in the temperature range of 5\u2013300 K. Spin-wave theory has been used to explain the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization and the approximate values for the exchange interactions for various tFe were obtained. The spin-wave constant B was found to increase linearly with the inverse in the Fe thickness (1/tFe). Using the ferromagnetic resonance technique, the change of the anisotropy field HK as a function of 1/tFe was deduced. The spatial distributions of the discrete spin-wave modes were calculated. All the extracted results were in agreement with those determined experimentally and found in the literature.", "In the present study, the influence of nano additives (Ni, Fe) and different mixing (turbular and magnetic) on the densification, microstructure and micro-hardness of the tungsten material under spark plasma sintering is analyzed. After turbulent mixing the nanoparticles are distributed widely in the W interparticle gaps but after magnetic mixing the nanoparticles are distributed not only on the gaps of the W particles but also on the broken surfaces. Ni incorporated tungsten materials achieved the maximum density of 98.3% at 1400 \u00b0C (turbular mixing) and 97.9% at 1300 \u00b0C (magnetic mixing). Fe incorporated tungsten material showed density of 97.7% at 1600 \u00b0C and 97.2% at 1400 \u00b0C after turbular and magnetic mixing. The influence of nanoparticles in the densification process was explained by Laplace force, boundary slip and Agte-Vacek effect. The microstructural analysis showed that nano-modification reduced the degree of porosity, and provides a compact material at low temperatures. X-ray fluorescence analysis reveals that magnetic mixing shows more uniform distribution of nanoparticles than turbular mixing. The nanoparticles incorporation increased the micro hardness of tungsten material. Hence, it is clear that magnetic mixing and nano modification greatly improved the densification and sintering behavior of the tungsten material.", "The Cu-containing steels are widely used for nuclear pressure vessel materials because of their good performance under high pressure and high temperature. In this article, magnetron sputtering was used to prepare iron films with various Cu contents. The samples were annealed at temperature range of 300\u2013500\u00a0\u00b0C, and the structural, mechanical, and magnetic properties were studied. The results show that both hardness and modulus change along with copper content and annealing temperature. The change in coercivity after annealing is similar to that of hardness. The crystal grain growth in matrix ferrum and Cu precipitation during annealing influences both the mechanical and magnetic properties.", "The corrosion-resistant coating formed on the surface of sintered Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B magnet by a phosphate chemical conversion (PCC) treatment was studied. The morphology, phase composition and thickness of the coating were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and coating thickness gauge. The corrosion behaviour of the phosphated magnet was evaluated by copper sulphate spot test, neutral salt spray test and electrochemical potentiodynamic polarization experiment. The magnetic properties of the phosphated magnet were also tested. The experimental results show that the phosphate coating has such characteristics as dense granular growth, uniform distribution and thickness range of 10\u201318\u00a0\u03bcm. The corrosion resistance of the magnet is significantly improved by phosphate coating without losing magnetic properties. Therefore, this highly efficient PCC was a good way for increasing the corrosion resistance of the sintered Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B magnets.", "The present work depends on recycling of fly ash by preparation of stoichiometric mullite containing various amounts of Co3O4; 0, 5, 10, 15 wt.% to obtain pigment ceramic materials. The mixtures were sintered at different temperatures; 1250, 1350, 1400, 1450, 1500 and 1550 \u2218C to follow the phase compositions, structure, physical, mechanical, electrical, magnetic properties and the color behaviors. The results indicate that the sintering at 1250 \u2218C is the optimum condition for the formation of the blue pigment ceramic materials. The sintering from 1250 to 1500 \u2218C shows increase in the bulk density and the strength properties up to 15 wt.% Co3O4. The incorporation of cobalt (II, III) oxide into the mullite system enhances the electrical and magnetic properties to be used as ferromagnetic materials.", "The effect of Gadolinium (Gd) substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of BiFeO3 is studied. Both BiFeO3 and (Bi0.7Gd0.3)FeO3 were synthesized in two steps: by high-energy ball milling of oxides for a total of 5 hours at 400 RPM and then sintering as-milled powders of BiFeO3 at 700\u00b0C/24 hours and (Bi0.7Gd0.3)FeO3 at 800\u00b0C /12 hours, to get the required phase. A structural transition is observed from rhombohedral (R3c) to orthorhombic (Pnma) as evident from the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) study. The orthorhombic structure of Gd-substituted sample is iso-structural with GdFeO3. (Bi0.7Gd0.3)FeO3 shows a soft ferromagnetic behaviour when compared to antiferromagnetic BiFeO3 at room temperature.", "We studied sintering temperature to enhance the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of 0.98(Na0.5K0.5)NbO3-0.02Ba(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 lead free piezoelectric ceramics. The synthesis and sintering method were the conventional ceramic techniques, and sintering was executed at 1080\u20131120\u00b0C. We found that the NKN-BZT ceramics showed the highest piezoelectric properties and ferroelectric properties at an optimal sintering temperature. The NKN-BZT ceramics sintered at 1100\u00b0C showed superior performance, with piezoelectric constant d33= 213 \u03c1C/N, and electromechanical coupling factor kp = 0.41%. These results reveal that NKN-BZT ceramics are promising candidate materials for lead-free piezoelectric applications.", "A series of Sr1\u2212xTixMnO3\u2212\u03b4 (0.05 \u2264 x \u2264 0.3) was fabricated by the solid-state reaction method. We studied the structural and thermoelectric properties of Sr1\u2212xTixMnO3\u2212\u03b4, with respect to the partial substitution of Ti4+ for Sr2+. The sintered Sr1\u2212xTixMnO3\u2212\u03b4 crystallized in the hexagonal perovskite-type structure with a space group of P63/mmc. For x \u2264 0.1, the partial substitution of Ti4+ for Sr2+ led to increases in the electrical conductivity and the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient, thus enhancing the power factor. The highest power factor (2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 Wm\u22121K\u22122) was obtained for Sr0.9Ti0.1MnO3\u2212\u03b4 at 800\u00b0C. The partial substitution of Ti4+ for Sr2+ in SrMnO3\u2212\u03b4 led to a significant improvement in the thermoelectric properties.", "Multilayer graphene shell encapsulated gold nanoparticle\u2014quantum dot hybrids were derived by combining wet-chemical, thermal, and covalent chemistry approaches. Uniformly patterned gold nanoparticles on a silicon substrate were obtained via gold film deposition in an electroless method followed by a thermal dewetting process. The resulting gold nanoparticles were further surface oxidized and utilized as catalysts for the chemical vapor deposition growth of multilayer graphene shell encapsulated on the gold nanoparticles (referred as \u201cmultilayer graphene shell encapsulated Au nanoparticle\u201d or graphene nanoparticles (GNPs)). As a next step, the surface of GNPs was modified to result in carboxylic (\u2212COOH) functionalities, which enabled carbodiimide-based covalent linking of amine-terminated CdSxSe1-x@ZnS quantum dots (QDs) on the GNP surface. The GNPs and GNP-QD heterostructures were characterized using scanning and transmission electron microscopy for size, morphology, spatial distribution, and crystal structure evaluation. In addition, UV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and discrete dipole approximation (DDA) modeling were utilized for understanding the band gap energies, fluorescence quenching, and light-matter interactions of the derived hybrids/heterostructures.", "A series of (BaO)x-(ZnO)1-x-TiO2 (x\u2009=\u20090.1\u20130.9) ceramic materials were synthesized via the conventional solid-state reaction method and finally sintered at 1200\u00a0\u00b0C. The diffraction pattern revealed that the cubic (Zn2Ti3O8 and BaTiO3) and monoclinic (Ba2ZnTi5O13) phases were present in the resultant compositions. The morphology was analysed using scanning electron microscope. The presence of metal oxide (M-O) stretching vibrations was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectra. The AC electrical properties such as dielectric constant (\u03b5r), loss tangent (tan \u03b4) and AC conductivity (\u03c3ac) were investigated as a function of temperature (313\u2013673\u00a0K) and frequency (100\u00a0Hz\u20135\u00a0MHz). The high dielectric constant and loss values were obtained for higher barium contents (beyond x\u2009=\u20090.5) owing to the presence of smaller number of monoclinic Ba2ZnTi5O13 phases. The effect of space-charge polarization was explained from dielectric modulus (M\u2032 and M\u2033) behaviour. The Nyquist plots (Z\u2032 versus Z\u2033) were drawn to justify the electrical conduction mechanism of all compositions. The bulk resistances (Rb) were calculated from Nyquist plots. The room temperature ferroelectric behaviour was illustrated with the help of P-E loop tracer.", "We present the first observation of room-temperature picosecond optical bistability in ZnSe-ZnTe multiple quantum wells (MQWs) grown by metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) on transparent CaF2(111) substrates. On the basis of the direction of the hysteresis loop, the absorption and the energy band structure in ZnSe-ZnTe MQWs, we show that the nonlinear mechanism for the optical bistability of ZnSe-ZnTe MQWs is due to the effect of increasing absorption, which is ascribed to the band gap shrinkage of ZnSe-ZnTe MQWs due to the high density of electrons and holes in the MQWs. The ps switching time can be explained by the electrons excited to the conduction band of ZnTe layer in ZnSe-ZnTe MQWs relaxing quickly to the conduction band of ZnSe layer in this material system.", "Thin polycrystalline films of the complex ferromagnetic ternary alloys Fe3Ga2-xAsx have been grown for the first time by atmospheric pressure metalorganic chemical vapour deposition. Initial data on the crystal structure and the magnetic properties of the films establish a marked dependency of such properties on the relative amounts of the non-magnetic atoms, gallium and arsenic, incorporated into the crystal lattice; this is entirely consistent with earlier measurements on bulk materials for this series of alloys.", "Samples of a-Si sputtered in a hydrogen enriched argon atmosphere were prepared under various hydrogen partial pressures and deposition temperatures and successfully doped with lithium. A decrease of the electrical conductivity and a shift of the absorption edge to the higher energy were observed and ascribed to the diminishing number of the localized states in the band gap due to the presence of hydrogen.", "We have measured the refractive index and its energy dispersion as well as the optical absorption edge energy for a matrix of reactively rf sputtered a-SiHx films. The major deposition variables were pH2 at fixed pAr and visa versa. The resonant 15N reaction has been used to profile the hydrogen content in the films. We have fitted the broad Si\ue5f8H stretch absorption band to two Gaussian peaks centered at 2008 cm\u22121 and 2100 cm\u22121, and computed the fraction of H bonded as dihydride (XD). As pH2 was increased from 0.4 to 3.0 mTorr at fixed pAr of 7 mTorr, XD increased from 0.57 to 0.77, while H content increased from 22.4 to 27.1 atomic percent. Eg\u2032, the optical gap normalized to 22% H, shows a marginally significant increase with XD. The films deposited at pAr = 20\u201340 mTorr displayed progressively lower refractive indices but insignificant changes in optical gaps. An optically computed void fraction of 25% was found for the 40 mTorr film.", "Amorphous Ge\ue5f8Si:H alloys have been prepared by rf sputtering in an argon-hydrogen atmosphere of varying hydrogen partial pressures. Electrical transport properties in the temperature range of 80 K to 373 K and optical and structural properties of these films have been measured. It is found that for a fixed Ge\ue5f8Si composition, the hydrogen content strongly affects the electrical conductivity. The absorption edge has been seen to suffer an initial blue shift yielding to a small red shift at higher hydrogen concentrations and is consistent with the conductivity data. The optical pseudo-gap obtained approaches closer to twice the corresponding mobility gap at higher hydrogen concentrations. Structural studies by Raman scattering confirm the amorphous nature of the films. Raman spectra also reveals the presence of various hydrogenic and lattice modes attributable to silicon\ue5f8hydrogen, germanium\ue5f8hydrogen, Si\ue5f8Si and Ge\ue5f8Ge interactions. The depolarization ratio \u03f1, measured for both unannealed annealed samples, indicates stabilization, due to annealing at selected temperatures. In view of the development of possible material for photovoltaic conversion of solar energy, it is suggested that by an appropriate choice of a fixed Ge\ue5f8Si composition and varying the hydrogen content it will be possible to optimize the electrical conductivity and optical band gap in sputtered hydrogenated a-Ge\ue5f8Si alloys.", "The density of states (DOS) of magnetron sputtered a-Si:H has been determined by measuring the depletion layer capacitance C(\u03c9, T) of Schottky-barrier diodes and the SCL-current of n /i/n (p//\u03c0/p) sandwich configurations. Both methods show that for low-defect material the DOS of 1 \u03bcm thick films amounts between 5 \u00d7 1015 and 1017 cm\u22123 eV\u22121 in a wide range of the band gap 0.45 eV \u2266 EC \u2212 E \u2266 1.05 eV, where Ec is the energy of the lower edge of the conduction band. A flat maximum near EC \u2212 E = 0.8 eV is indicated by capacitance measurements. The influence of preparation parameters to the SCLC-DOS is demonstrated as well as the change of the midgap DOS after intense light illumination and after electron irradiation.", "The reflectivity and transmission of a-Si1\u2212yNiy:H alloys, prepared by radio-frequency sputtering, have been measured for films with nickel concentrations on both sides of the semiconductor-metal transition. With increasing nickel content, the absorption edge broadens and the optical gap decreases, reaching zero at approximately y = 0.26. For larger values of y, the reflectivity falls with increasing photon energy, a variation which can be interpreted in terms of free-carrier Drude-like behaviour with a very short scattering time.", "Off-resonant third-order non-linear optical susceptibility, \u03c7(3)(\u22123\u03c9; \u03c9, \u03c9, \u03c9), of tin oxide thin film is evaluated by the third-harmonic generation method. The tin oxide thin films of various oxygen contents are prepared successively by an rf magnetron sputtering technique under precise control of the gas pressure during sputtering. The value of \u03c7(3) of amorphous SnO2\u2212x ranges from 10\u221212 to 10\u221211 esu and is larger by several times than that of polycrystalline SnO2 thin film. A larger susceptibility is observed in amorphous SnO2\u2212x of lower oxygen content. These results are explained on the basis of the electronic structure of tin oxides and are summarized as follows. (1) The introduction of a sufficient amount of oxygen deficiency into SnO2 results in the formation of Sn2+. (2) The optical band gap of amorphous SnO2\u2212x becomes smaller with the formation of Sn2+ than that of SnO2. (3) The non-linear susceptibility becomes large with narrowing of the band gap, as predicted by the quantum mechanical formula of the third-order optical susceptibility.", "Amorphous and microcrystalline GaN thin films have been made by reactive sputtering. Transparent films of optical gap, Eo5 \u223c 3.95 eV, are obtained and these show semiconductor characteristics. The conductivity changes dramatically from \u223c 10\u221211 S/cm to \u223c 10\u22123 S/cm on microcrystallization. Photoconductivity is observed in a-GaN. The results of electron spin resonance and sub-gap absorption suggest a low mid-gap defect density of states. It is demonstrated that an amorphous semiconducting material with a large optical gap can be obtained.", "Films of amorphous GexSe100-x were prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) using the hydrides GeH4 and H2Se as precursor gases and by standard thermal evaporation. The optical bandgap obtained from a Tauc plot showed a maximum (Eg = 2.27 eV) at the stoichiometric composition (x = 33) for the PECVD films. The bandgap values of the virgin evaporated films were much lower in the range x = 40 to 75, the difference being due to the incorporation of hydrogen in the PECVD films, detected in IR and Raman spectra. Thermal annealing and illumination by bandgap light of the evaporated films induced irreversible bleaching. The PECVD films showed a more complex behaviour of the optical shift upon annealing due to the loss of hydrogen. An IR and Raman investigation demonstrated that the changes in the optical transparency are accompanied by an increase of ordering in the local structure.", "Calculations are presented for the sputtering yields averaged over energy and angular distributions of incident deuterium and tritium ions on various materials proposed for the divertor plates and first wall of a tokamak reactor (C, Al, Ti, Fe, Mo, W). Modifications to the particle energy distribution function due to acceleration in the sheath electric field are included and the calculations are performed over the energy range characteristic of the particles in the plasma boundary. The results are restricted to the case of magnetic field lines normal to the divertor plate surface.", "Research on phase relationships and structure studies by electron diffraction confirm VnO2n\u22121 (n = 3\u20139) phases between V2O3 and VO2. Metal-insulator phase transitions have been found in all phases but V3O5 and V7O13. Electrical, magnetic and thermodynamic properties associated with the transitions are reported for sintered samples or for single crystals prepared by a vapor-transport method. The results are collated and reviewed in summarized form.", "A series of ruthenates with the perovskite-like arrangement has been synthesized. The general formula is (ACu3)(Ru4)O12 where (A Cu3) and (Ru4) occupy the A and B sites of the ideal ABO3 perovskite structure, respectively; A = Na+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Cd2+, La3+, Pr3+, and Nd3+. The change of the A site charge is balanced by a change of the ruthenium valence (+3, +4, or +5). The stability of the structure is strongly related to the relative size of the cations on the dodecahedral and octahedral sites. The magnetic susceptibility of the compounds with A = Na, Ca, and La is temperature independent above 70\u00b0K (for Ca), 120\u00b0K (for La), or 220\u00b0K (for Na) (Pauli paramagnetism). Resistivity measurements made on sintered samples between 77 and 300\u00b0K confirm the metallic nature of these compounds.", "Powdery spinel lithium ferrite, Li0.5Fe2.5O4, was prepared from a mixture of complex ferric formate and lithium formate at different temperatures ranging from 300 to 700\u00b0C. The largest specific surface areas were established with samples obtained at 500\u00b0C. The highest density, reaching 98% of the theoretical lithium ferrite density, was found with the same samples on sintering at 1100\u00b0C. Some magnetic parameters of the high-density samples were measured.", "57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy has been used to characterize a series of discrete Fe\ue5f8N phases obtained by reactive (Fe + N2) sputtering, under varying conditions, which included the power used and the variation in the partial pressures of nitrogen and an inert gas, such as argon. Phases, such as Fe4N, Fe3N, Fe2N, etc., were identified by carrying out measurements down to 80 K, as well as their phase transformations were studied by extending the measurements in the high-temperature region up to 553 K. The magnetic ordering in these phases has been also established.", "Lead Germanate Pb5Ge3O11 thin films were prepared by reactive dc-sputtering of a metallic target. At substrate temperatures below 300\u00b0C, the films are amorphous. The transformation from this amorphous to the crystalline state is studied by differential scanning calorimetry and dielectric measurement.", "The electrical resistivity and superconducting properties of a newly synthesized superconducting material of the form Pb3BiSx (x = 1.5\u20133.0) composed of all non-transition elements are presented. The sample film is fabricated by quick evaporation of the original sintered material. It is found that temperature dependence of electrical resistivity has anomalous behavior as represented by broad maximum in higher temperature region and minimum in lower temperature region. The critical temperature is about 8K and the critical field is 35 kOe at 4.2 K for the sample with x = 1.9. The transition width is very broad for the magnetic transition, in contrast to the sharp transition at Tc. The gap structure of a Pb3BiSx-I-Sn tunnel junction is also presented.", "151Eu M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy measurements on two amorphous samples of EuPdx (x = 2.4 and 3.0) prepared by sputtering, show the presence of inhomogeneous mixed valent (Eu2+ and Eu3+) states with sample averaged valencies 2.25 and 2.85 respectively. Magnetic ordering and hyperfine fields are visible on the Eu2+ components. The two charge states have the same effective Debye temperature.

At all fields and temperatures Rf exhibits a S-shape variation with current. For the well-prepared low-resitivity samples Rf reaches in the linear V-I regime a value of 0.15Rn, Rn being the normal resistance just above the transition, consistent with picture of the decoupled superconducting grains. Because of self-field effects, J obtained from transport (and magnetization) measurements does not provide useful information on the nature of intergrain coupling. The distributions of critical currents (d2V/dl2 vs. I) seem to rule out larger enhancement of Jc in sintered samples.", "In this letter, the photoluminescence signals in low optical gap (below 2.0 eV) a-C : H : N films were investigated. Films were deposited by r.f. sputtering of a graphite target in Ar\ue5f8H2\ue5f8N2 atmospheres having different Ar N 2 flow rate ratios. We have found photoluminescence signals of high intensity and having a peak energy well over 2.0 eV. These results are discussed on the basis of a model in which the sp2 clusters are considered as luminescence centres. Nitrogenation effect upon the luminescence centres and the luminescence intensity correlation with nitrogen concentration are also discussed, in the light of the presented model.", "Polycrystalline thin-film transistors using sputtered Si films followed by high temperature crystallization have been fabricated and characterised. An analytical model has been proposed to explain the current-voltage characteristics of the TFT covering the sub-threshold, linear and saturation regions. The model assumes a spatial uniform distribution of trap states consisting of tail and deep states. The tail states have an exponential distribution within the bandgap, and the deep states are found to have a uniform distribution. The trap parameters can be easily extracted, and the model gives excellent agreement with experimental results.", "The sputter gun system has a unique feature which is that the substrate holder is electrically isolated from and physically outside the cathode and anode gun assembly. As a result the substrate surface temperature can be maintained at a lower level than that for the conventional diode sputtering system. This feature is particularly useful for metallization by the lift-off process. NiFe films with excellent physical and magnetic properties have been obtained. The application to overlay patterns for single-level masking bubble devices is presented.", "Results of studies on the switching process in ferroelectric Ba(Ti0.98Sn0.02)O3 films obtained by the sintering method are presented. Two switching mechanisms were observed: a nucleation with an activation field \u03b11of 2.7 kV cm-1 and lateral motion of the domain walls with an activation field \u03b12of 6 kV cm-1. The observed asymmetry of the switching currents is caused by the polarization which concentrates at defects on the substrate-thin ferroelectric film boundary.", "The preparation, structural and physical properties (superconductivity and magnetism) of metallic superlattices prepared by a sputtering technique developed by us are presented. X-ray diffraction, ion mill Auger and ion scattering spectroscopy, superconducting Tc and Hc values, as well as magnetization measurements, are described.", "Metal/oxide/semiconductor and metal/insulator/semiconductor structures on Ga1\u2212xInxAs (x=0.35 and 0.10) were studied. The insulators were N2-annealed plasma-grown oxide and chemically vapour-deposited Si3N4. The interface properties are similar for both insulators (probably because of the presence of a native oxide at the Si3N4-substrate interface). On material with x=0.35 a relatively low density of states allows Fermi level movement throughout most of the band gap, and inversion seems possible on both n- and p-type material. On material with x=0.10 poor interface properties are observed. A peak (above 1013cm-2eV-1) of acceptor states located approximately 0.7\u20130.8 eV above the valence band maximum is observed for Ga1\u2212xInxAs (x=0.35 or 0.10) and for GaAs. It is probably associated with an arsenic-related defect (an arsenic vacancy or a gallium atom on an arsenic site). For indium concentrations lower than about 30% this trap level is too deep in the band gap and poor interface properties result.", "The magnetic properties of sputtered Co-Ir thin films and the relation between the properties and the film microstructure were studied. Thin films obtained by sputtering a Co-Ir alloy containing 10\u201320 at.% Ir exhibited high coercivity. The maximum coercivity was obtained for a composition of Co-15at.%Ir. The film remanence decreased with increasing iridium concentration. The film coercivity also increased with an increase in the average grain diameter of the films.", "The influence of the molybdenum content of thin amorphous (Gd1\u2212xCox)1\u2212yMoy films was studied. Samples were prepared with an r.f sputtering technique with values of x ranging from 0.66 to 0.97 and y ranging from 0.04 to 0.14. It was found that the concentration of molybdenum influences the saturation magnetization, the g factor and the uniaxial anisotropy field. The anisotropy constant is greatly influenced by molybdenum, especially near the compensation concentration.", "With a view to possible applications as perpendicular recording media, thin films of composition (Co90Cr10)100 \u2212 xTMx were made, where TM denotes vanadium, niobium, molybdenum or tantalum and x is between zero and 20 at.%. The films were prepared by ion beam sputtering from composite targets. The basic magnetic properties such as anisotropy and coercivity were determined. The magnetization was also studied as a function of temperature. A very striking result is the relatively low coercivity for TM \u2261 V (about 500 Oe), which is independent of substrate temperature. X-ray diffraction revealed strong structural variations with different transition metals. With molybdenum and tantalum substitutions, films with a sharp [00.1] texture were obtained leading to perpendicular anisotropy. Transmission electron microscopy on thinner films showed the films with TM \u2261 Nb, Mo and Ta to be microcrystalline or amorphous. In contrast, the (Co90Cr10)100 \u2212 xVx films were coarse grained; this is possibly related to their relatively low coercivity and broad [00.1] texture.", "Lead titanate thin films with a perovskite structure were successfully fabricated on titanium substrates by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). These films were characterized according to composition, crystal structure and dielectric and ferroelectric properties. Semiquantitative compositional analysis of the deposited films was carried out with Auger electron spectroscopy. The lead titanate films obtained by CVD have the stoichiometric composition. The lead titanate layer has a columnar structure and grows with a (001) preferred orientation. A clear dielectric transition and offset in the d.c. conductivity near the transition temperature (480\u00b0C) were observed in the deposited film of thickness 4.7 \u03bcm. The remanent polarization and the coercive field measured from the ferroelectric hysteresis loop are 14.1 \u03bcC cm\u22122 and 20.16 kV cm\u22121 respectively.", "Thin films of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been grown on Si\u3008100\u3009 substrates by ion beam sputter deposition using an ultrahigh vacuum system with in situ diagnostic equipment (reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and Auger spectrometer). The crystalline quality of the films was determined by RHEED, X-ray diffraction and channelling of a 4He+ ion beam. The YSZ layers deposited within the 700\u2013900\u00b0C temperature range under an oxygen partial pressure of about 10\u22124 Pa exhibited a monocrystalline cubic phase. The crystallographic continuity between the silicon substrate and the YSZ film estimated by channelling gives a \u03c7min value of between 9.5% and 20%, depending on the deposition procedure. High frequency capacitance-voltage curves were measured for metal-YSZ-silicon capacitance. For a layer thickness of 0.3 \u03bcm, the accumulation capacitance gives a value of about 25 for the permittivity. The density of surface states at the YSZ-silicon interface determined by the Termann method is less than 1012 eV\u22121 cm\u22122 in the middle of the band gap with an increase near the conduction and the valence bands.", "Recent interest in thin film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ferroelectrics has been intensified by the possible applications of these materials to non-volatile random access memory devices. In general, these thin films have different properties when compared with bulk ceramics of the same composition (Zr:Ti ranging from 48:52 to 30:70). We have begun investigating the composition and microstructure of sputtered submicron PZT films via electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Bulk analysis of various films (EPMA) shows reasonable agreement with the composition of the target (especially Zr:Ti ratios). SEM illustrates a variety of microstructures which primarily depend on target material, sputtering conditions and substrate morphology. Plan-view TEM has been used to investigate the grain orientation and morphology of the ferroelectric films. Grain size for PZT varies considerably from tens of nanometers to several hundred nanometers. The grain size depends on the composition of the films and the sputtering conditions. Cross-sectional TEM samples are being studied to determine the degree of abruptness of the various heterointerfaces in a device structure.", "Thin magnetic films of Co-Cr have been obliquely deposited by evaporation and sputtering at a fixed incidence angle of 45\u00b0 using tilted sample holders. The layers exhibit a columnar microstructure with the column axes at an angle in the range 15\u00b0\u201335\u00b0 with respect to the film normal. The tilt angle strongly depends on the type of substrate used, the deposition temperature and the substrate pretreatment. The c axes of the h.c.p. crystallites always coincide with the column axes. A Ti underlayer forces the columns and crystallites of the Co-Cr film to grow vertically to the film plane despite the oblique incidence deposition process.", "The electrical characteristics of double-oxide metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures on n-GaAs have been studied. The oxide layers were anodic and sputtered SiO2. The parameters analyzed were current conduction mechanism, resistivity, breakdown electric field, capacitance-voltage relationships and oxide fixed charges. Overall, the quality of this structure was inferior compared with the all-anodic oxide MOS structures. However, the parameters of the double-oxide MOS structure were considerably improved after rapid high temperature annealing. The sputter created damage; its removal and changes in the composite oxide structure after high temperature annealing were used to explain the observations.", "DyFeCo films were d.c. sputtered from a magnetically unbalanced magnetron cathode. Their density, composition and magnetic properties were investigated systematically as a function of the sputter parameters pressure and power, and were compared with evaporated films. They exhibit a lower anisotropy constant and behave in terms of the ferrimagnetic properties like evaporated films with 5 at.% less transition metal content. Corresponding magneto-optical discs show a low recording performance. These effects are attributed to the bombardment of the growing layer with energetic particles during deposition, which probably leads to a precipitation of transition metal clusters in the amorphous matrix, possibly nanoscale superparamagnetic transition metal crystallites.", "Magnetic and structural properties of gamma iron oxide thin films depend significantly on the orientation of the substrate with respect to the direction of source vapour during the growth of films by the reactive chemical vapour dissociation technique. Formation of large grains and grain clusters is observed for flat deposited films as compared with compact small grains at oblique incidence. Such structural variation modifies the anisotropy in the film, resulting in high coercivity of 770 Oe and remanence of 2.7 kG in undoped \u03b3-Fe2O3 films.", "Thin films of CoCr are considered to be the most promising media for high-density perpendicular magnetic recording. It is shown that when depositing single CoCr layers onto a Si substrate by dc magnetron sputtering excellent magnetic and morphological properties can be achieved. The growth of nodular defects hindering a small head to medium spacing is characterized by cross-sectional TEM and discussed on the basis of a shadowing model treated by computer simulations.", "The paper is a critical review of the present status of the magnetron ion sputter plating of thin TiN films. Thus different possibilities of extracting high ion current ls from the magnetron discharge to substrates located not only at standard target to substrate distances dS-T of about 50 mm but also at larger distances dS-T are discussed in detail. Special attention is devoted to magnetron sputtering systems with enhanced ionization, to plasma confinement in the magnetron sputtering systems and to the discharge characteristics of an unbalanced magnetron (UM). It is shown that a UM can be operated in the regime of a double-site-sustained discharge (DSSD) and in this case large ls can be extracted to substrates located in large dS-T of about 200 mm and even at high pressures p = 5 Pa. A physical comparison of the conventional magnetron (CM), UM and DSSD is also given. Considerable attention is also devoted to the effect of ion bombardment on properties of TiN films created in the sputtering system using DSSD. It is shown that the microstructure of TiN films seems to be controlled by the combined parameter Ep = e (Upl\u2212Us) \u03bdi/\u03bdm \u223c eUsis/aD, i.e by the energy delivered per condedering particle, where Upl is the plasma potential, Us is the substrate bias, \u03bdi and \u03bdm are the fluxes of ions and metal atoms impinging on the substrate, respectively, is is the substrate ion current density, and aD is the deposition rate. At low negative biases |Us\u2a8550 V, the microstructure of created TiN films strongly depends on is. At low is \u2a85 1 mA cm\u22122 porous black TiN films and at higher is > 1 mA cm\u22122 compact, dense, bright golden TiN films are created independently of the distance dS-T. The colour of TiN films prepared in a DSSD, i.e. the brilliance L\u2217 = 77\u201379, the redness a\u2217 = 0.3\u20130.8 and the yellowness b\u2217 = 41\u201344, compare well with the colour of the best TiN films prepared by standard ion plating and the cathodic arc processes. It has been shown that with DSSD good quality TiN films can be produced at distance dS-T up to 200 mm. In principle, the distance dS-T can be longer but the magnetic field strength must be sufficient at the substrate to ensure adequate plasma confinement in the space between the target and substrates. The DSSD represents a new qualitative step in magnetron sputter ion plating of thin films and the related sputtering system is also suitable for coating large three-dimensional parts and it is fully competitive with standard commercial deposition devices based on low voltage electron beam (LVEB), triode and arc evaporation.", "In the present paper a new magnetron sputtering source is described which, due to its particular magnetic system design, can work successfully at gas pressures (20\u2013100 mPa) nearly one order of magnitude lower than those commonly used in magnetron sputtering systems. The source offers possibilities for controlled bombardment of the growing film with charged particles from the discharge plasma in a wide range of current densities and accelerating voltages.", "A dc pseudo-magnetron sputter-cleaning device with a magnetic system located opposite the cathode (i.e. the substrate to be etched) was developed. Its physical properties, such as I\ue5f8V characteristics, erosion effects and cleaning performance, were compared with a simple diode sputter-cleaning system. Deposits on substrates etched by the new device have shown a drastic increase in adhesion. The etched surfaces were investigated in respect to evolution of surface morphology and composition due to preferential sputtering. It was found that the etching process leads to greater substrate surface roughness. This fact indicates that the increase of adhesion is caused mainly by contamination removal, mechanical interlocking and surface activation. Sufficient etching could be obtained for different materials, even for composites such as CuSnPb. Apart from the cleaning effect the etch process could be used to heat the substrate to the desired temperature prior to deposition.", "Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films have been deposited using an unbalanced magnetron, giving film deposition rates of around 3 nm s\u22121, a substrate bias of 30 V and an ion current of 2.50 mA cm\u22122. A polycrystalline silicon target was reactively sputtered in argon at 3 mtorr and hydrogen partial pressures ranging between 0 and 1 mtorr. Dopants of antimony and indium were also sputtered at the same time as the silicon in order to tailor the absorption coefficient and band gap of the resulting films. The analysis of dopant concentrations was undertaken using SIMS. A novel technique for calculating the absorption coefficients of the a-Si:H films by eliminating interference effects, using three measured optical parameters, is reported here. By replacing hydrogen with oxygen as the reactive gas, it was found to be possible to produce silicon oxides as films with a range of compositions, having optical properties ascribed to the monoxide through to the dioxide, refractive indices from 2 down to 1.45, with optical absorption occurring in the blue region of the spectrum for those with the highest indices.", "The manner in which the coercivity, permeability and resistivity of films of Fe-M-X (M : Ta, Hf, Zr, Nb; X: N, C, Ar;) and Permalloy varied because of particular conditions during DC magnetron sputter deposition has been determined. The effects of reactive gases and substrate bias during the sputtering process were studied and the measured values for Hc\u2032 \u03bc and \u03f1 were compared with the results from formulae derived from gas impurity pinning and scattering theory. For Fe-M-X films, the coercivity could be modified from 1.2 Oe to 0.4 Oe and the permeability from 3 \u00d7 103 to 8.5 \u00d7 103 (1 MHz) by altering the partial pressure of nitrogen between 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 Torr and 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 Torr. The coercivity of Permalloy films could be adjusted from 8 Oe to 0.5 Oe and their permeability altered from 200 to 820 (1MHz) by changing the substrate bias between 0V and \u2212 100V.", "Diamond like carbon (DLC) films were deposited (thickness \u2248 100\u2013130 nm) by RF plasma CVD of ethylene on to mica and silicon substrates at room temperature. Optical properties of the films deposited at different negative self bias (VB) voltages (0 to \u2212 805 V) were measured. The refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of DLC films on mica varied within 1.6\u20132.1 and 0.035\u20130.128, respectively while the band gap energy (Eg) decreased from 2.38 to 2.01 eV with increase in VB from 0 to \u2212 805 V. The internal stress (compressive in nature) of these films (on mica) along with that of films deposited by sputtering of vitreous carbon target (on glass) was obtained from the broadening of the optical absorption band tail. The stress on mica (0.2\u20131.0 GPa) was observed to be comparable to the stress on silicon substrates (0.18\u20132.1 GPa), measured by the flexure of beam technique. The hardness of DLC films on mica varied within 6.5\u20138 GPa while that on Si varied within 6\u20139.5 GPa. The hardness of sputtered films on glass substrate was \u22488.7 GPa.", "The phases coexisting with the magnetic boride Fe14Nd2B at 298 K are \u03b1-Fe, Fe17Nd2, Fe4NdB4, and \u03b1-Nd. Metastable \u03b2-Nd and a modification of the magnetic boride are suggested by electron diffraction patterns. No Fe2Nd was found. The interaction between the magnetic boride and the Nd-rich liquid during sintering and/or heat treating is complex. It breaks up particles and introduces inclusions and is responsible for the unique properties of the sintered magnets. The liquid solidifies into a eutectic whose presence causes serious degradation in a corrosive environment. The variation of the microhardness of the magnetic boride with alloy composition and heat treatment is discussed.", "With the help of a calculated full powder diffraction pattern of hexagonal Fe17Nd5, a = 2.0214 nm, c = 1.2329 nm, it is verified that the phase has been observed under different experimental conditions: in binary Fe-Nd by annealing at 600\u00b0C, in melt-spun Fe-Nd by annealing at 577\u00b0C, and in Fe-Nd-O by reaction sintering followed by a 600\u00b0C anneal. The same X-ray diffraction fingerprint is found in Fe(-Ti)-Sm where it had been synthesized by cathodic sputtering, or by mechanical alloying. Whereas the Sm phase is magnetically hard, the Nd phase is not. Other phases observed in the Fe-Nd system, in addition to Fe17Nd2 and Fe17Nd5, are metastable Fe17Nd, which can be stabilized by adding Ti, and a magnetically hard phase, also with 12.5 at.% Nd, Tc = 230\u00b0C. which is possibly impurity stabilized. The three forms of the Nd solid solution, in polytype notation, hexagonal 4H and 2H, and cubic 3R can be observed under the following conditions: 4H in as-cast alloys, 2H in rapidly solidified binary Fe-Nd, and 2H and 3R in sintered Fe-Nd-B magnets. 3R and 2H are stabilized by impurities (oxygen) and can also contain dissolved Fe which is likely to be interstitial.", "Thin films of (PbCa)TiO3 were produced by rf-sputtering of a ceramic target at substrate temperatures between room temperature and 250 \u00b0C, followed by an annealing process at temperatures in the range between 450 \u00b0C and 650 \u00b0C. The films were studied by scanning electron microscope, electron microprobe analysis, X-ray- and dielectric measurements. Annealing at lower temperatures leads to smaller, annealing at higher temperatures leads to larger grain size and consequently to films with clearly tetragonal symmetry. In the latter case, the lattice constants are consistent with the values of the starting composition and the films show ferroelectric properties. The remanent polarization Pr is extremely small for the nanocrystalline films, but it reaches values of Pr = 30 \u03bcC/cm2 for films with large grains.", "Highly conductive p-type microcrystalline SiC:H films have been prepared by ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) plasma CVD. The material with an optical energy gap of 2.25 eV exhibits a dark conductivity as high as 10 S cm-1 which is more than seven orders of magnitude higher than that of amorphous SiC:H prepared by conventional RF plasma CVD. The optimal energy gap can be controlled in the range from 2.0 to 2.8 eV, while retaining excellent conductivity. Utilizing this material as a wide-gap heterojunction contact in amorphous silicon solar cell, a conversion efficiency of 12.0% has been obtained with a large open circuit voltage.", "Preparation of thin films by MOCVD, particularly of GaAs and related alloys, is an established process which is now being extended to metal and mixed metal oxides. Low temperature processing of photolytic MOCVD using lasers and are lamps is an alternative technique; however, its application to oxide deposition has been slow due to lack of appropriate precursors. This paper discusses some of the precursor design and synthesis, in particular for photochemical deposition of insulating and ferroelectric oxides.", "Tellurium suboxide (TeOx thin films were deposited on non-intentionally heated fused quartz substrates by RF reactive sputtering, with x = 1.3, as calculated from Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy measurements. Optical studies were performed in air at room temperature for both as-deposited and thermally annealed (250\u00b0C for 5 min in Ar atmosphere) films. The refractive index n and the extinction coefficient k were evaluated through transmissivity and reflectivity measurements at room temperature in the range of wavelengths between 200 and 1500 nm. The optical absorption spectrum as a function of the incident photon energy was also determined in order to evaluate the optical gap. Finally electron microscopy analysis has revealed that the film structure attains a shorter range order after the annealing.", "This paper reviews our recent atom probe studies of nanostructured alloys which are fabricated by three methods: (1) crystallization from metallic glasses, (2) sputter film deposition, and (3) phase decomposition. Alloys with nanograin structures display various interesting magnetic or mechanical properties which are not attainable in conventional alloys. In the first half of this paper, we focus our discussion on the evolution of nanocrsytalline structure from metallic glasses by the primary crystallization process. By atom probe analyses, we found evidence that heterogeneities of one of the alloying elements are present in the initial stage of crystallization. In the later stage of crystallization, one of the slow diffusers controls crystal grain growth. In the second half of this paper, we discuss the nanostructure of Co\ue5f8Cr sputtered thin films and Cr\ue5f8Fe alloys, in which phase separation plays a critical role for controlling magnetic properties. Co\ue5f8Cr has an equilibrium two-phase region below 400\u00b0C, at which temperature the bulk diffusion is negligible. However, by producing alloy thin films by the sputter deposition method at elevated temperatures (200\u00b0C\u2013400\u00b0C), we have observed the presence of the equilibrium two-phase state and improved magnetic properties for these films. Cr\ue5f8Fe films and bulk alloys both show giant magnetoresistance (GMR). The MR value changes depending on the microstructural evolution, and the origins of MR are discussed on the basis of the atom probe results.", "Ferroelectric PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) and Ba0.65Sr0.35TiO3 (BST) thin films are prepared by laser ablation of sintered ceramic targets. The influence of the substrate temperature during deposition on the composition and the crystallographic structure is investigated for different substrates, in order to achieve an oriented or epitaxial growth.", "Pb1\u2212xCaxTiO3 thin films with thickness in the 200\u20131000 nm range have been prepared by pulsed laser deposition on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/(100)Si substrates. 10% weight PbO-rich ceramic targets have been ablated with a KrF excimer laser. It has been found that the Ca concentration of the films remains close to its concentration in the target (x = 0.24). Optimized crystalline orientation is obtained using non sintered targets, on the other hand optimized tetragonality has been found in 600 nm thick films. The films show an asymmetric ferroelectric behavior.", "Some electrical and magnetic properties of Gd-Co films obtained by dc sputtering with bias voltage Vb are discussed. We observed a decrease in the compensation temperature and in the anomalous Hall resistivity with increasing bias voltage while the specific resistivity increases. The anisotropy constant, however, increases up to Vb = -200 V, where it reaches a maximum and then it decreases. Electrical conductivity of the films prepared with Vb greater than -100 V showed tunneling character. We conclude that not only resputtering of Gd atoms but also oxidation of Gd takes place during deposition when bias voltage is applied.", "The relation between interatomic distance and hyperfine field is examined for Fe-Ni Invar films produced by dc sputtering. The hyperfine field of sputter-deposited films is much larger than that of bulk alloys, which is interpreted by a change in 3d band configuration by incorporation of Ar atoms.", "Surface modes in spin wave resonance in thin amorphous films of (Gd1-xCox)1-yMoy alloys were studied. The samples were obtained with rf sputtering technique and a bias voltage was applied. Technological conditions were carefully pre-determined for which surface modes were excited in the resonance experiment. One surface mode was present for samples just after deposition and two modes could be observed in some cases for the same samples kept at room temperature for two or three months. The surface anisotropy constant Ks was determined from the surface inhomogeneity (SI) model with symmetrical or non-symmetrical boundary conditions for one or two surface modes, respectively. The fitted Ks values agree with theoretically predicted ones and they are also compatible with numbers found by experimentalists for monocrystalline, polycrystalline or amorphous films. For all samples we also determined the critical angles \u03b8c's between the external magnetic field and the normal to the film plane for which the position of the surface mode coincides with the position of the first volume mode. The corresponding critical angles \u03d1c's for the magnetization differ from \u03c0/4 which suggests the presence of surface inhomogeneities of the magnetization distribution.", "High voltage Lorentz electron microscopy reveals the existence of four types of bubbles in HO19Co81 sputter-deposited films. A bubble with vertical Bloch lines remains, without collapsing, at a higher field than that for those without Bloch lines. A change in image contrast with magnetic field is also discussed.", "Amorphous Fe1\u2212xBx (0.12 \u2a7d x \u2a7d 0.60) films were deposited by the sputtering method. The temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization Ms(T) was measured and the crystallization temperatures Tx(x) were determined in the whole concentration range. The exponent from the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation was determined from the isothermal dependences of the magnetization versus time Ms(t). The values of the exponent obtained as well as scanning microscopy observations indicated the existence of two stages of the crystallization process: (1) growth of the few existing crystallites; (2) creation of new crystallites.", "The microstructure-magnetic property relationship in Nd-Fe-B-type permanent magnetic materials has been investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy and analyses of the temperature dependence of the intrinsic coercivity. Effects of postsintering heat treatment, mean grain size in sintered magnets, magnetic separation of the magnetic grains by non-magnetic phases, and the degree of alignment of the c-axis of the magnetic grains have been studied in permanent magnets based on Pr2Fe14B. Results indicate that local demagnetization fields are the main sources of a reduction of the intrinsic coercivity in this type of magnets.", "The effect of a partial substitution of Fe by Cr up to 16 at% on the phase structure, demagnetization curves, Curie temperature and corrosion behaviour of Nd16Fe76B8 permanent magnets has been investigated. Microstructure of the tested alloys has shown the following phases: Nd2(Fe,Cr)14B, Nd(Fe,Cr)2 and for alloys containing \u2a7e4 at% Cr additionally FeCr inclusions. With the increase of Cr content the remanence and Curie temperature decrease. The intrinsic coercive force of these magnets increases up to 6 at % Cr and then rapidly decreases. The corrosion behaviour of the tested magnets in various condition is also discussed. It is shown that greater additions of Cr influence the corrosion process of the magnets in acid solution and in atmospheric environments in a rather small degree.", "Co/Mo multilayers have been prepared by using ion-beam sputtering. The samples had a periodic layered structure and an in-plane easy axis of magnetization. The structures of Co layers were disordered, fcc or fcc + hcp, depending upon the thickness of the Co layer (tCo), as well as the thickness of the Mo layer (tMo). A nonmagnetic compound, Co7Mo6, was observed to form at the Co/Mo interfaces, unlike compounds found in Co/Mo multilayers prepared by magnetron sputtering. The existence of this compound was considered to be an important reason for the decrease of the saturation magnetization of crystalline samples with tCo < 40 \u00c5, among others. The dependence of the coercivity on tCo and/or tMo was also studied.", "The magnetic properties of Mn-Al alloys depend on their chemical compositions, grain size, sintering temperature and additives, and are process sensitive. Effects of the sintering temperature, and the carbon addition on the magnetic properties of sintering Mn-Al magnets have been investigated. The electrical resistivity and magnetization of Mn-Al alloys have been studied between 4 and 1200 K. Large differences have been observed between the \u03c4-phase and other non-magnetic phases. The best magnetic properties for the isotropic sintered samples in this study are Br = 2800 G, bHc = 1500 Oe, and (BH)max = 1.2 MG Oe.", "FeSi/Cu compositionally modulated films (CMFs) with different modulation wavelengths have been obtained by rf sputtering. When the thickness of Cu layers is fixed, the saturation magnetization and the Curie temperature of CMFs decrease with a decreasing thickness of magnetic layers. This result is caused by a dead layer effect and dimensional effects. For FeSi/Cu CMFs with the thickness of FeSi layers of 9 \u00c5, a linear thermomagnetic relation, i.e., the two-dimensional magnetism is obtained. Varying the thickness of Cu layers with fixed FeSi layer thickness, it is found that for Cu layers thinner than 15 \u00c5, the exchange coupling between FeSi layers appeared, but it caused the saturation magnetization of CMFs to decrease. A \u201cmictomagnetic-like\u201d phenomenon is observed at low temperature and low fields. This behavior is a consequence of irreversible effects due to the domain wall pinning.", "DC magnetron sputtering has been used to fabricate SmFe12 films with ThMn12 type of tetragonal structure. SmFe12Nx films were made by heating the sample in situ in a low pressure nitrogen atmosphere. The lattice parameters are a = 8.589 \u00c5, C = 4.807 \u00c5 for SmFe12 films and a = 8.735 \u00c5, c = 4.895 \u00c5 for SmFe12Nx films respectively, corr esponding to a volume increase of about 5.3% upon nitrogenation. A change of anisotropy and an increase of Curie temperature upon nitrogenation are observed. Aspects of crystal structure, texture and magnetic properties are reported.", "X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy show that in sputtered Fe/Cu multilayers the thinnest Fe layers (10.5 and 6.3 \u00c5) have fcc structure and a dramatically reduced magnetic moment. Thicker Fe layers (42 and 21 \u00c5) have a bcc structure tetragonally distorted toward fcc.", "Epitaxial Fe/Pt multilayers were deposited by sputtering onto (001) MgO. Transmission electron micrographs demonstrate the orientation relationship Fe (001)\u2016Pt (001) and Fe [110]\u2016Pt [100] in the films. Annealing produces the teteagonal ordered compound FePt with the magnetically easy c-axis oriented preferentially out of plane.", "We have sputtered copper/cobalt multilayers on kapton substrates for magnetic circular X-ray dichroism (MXD). Spectra recorded at Cu K-edge indicate a magnetic signal depending on copper thicknesses. This is experimental evidence for the magnetic polarization of copper in cobalt/copper multilayers. We present a realistic description of this effect based upon the naive RKKY theory.", "The structural and magnetic properties of sputtered Co Ag multilayers were studied as a function of anneal treatment. Smoothing of the interfaces, strain relaxation, and phase separation of Co and Ag were observed. The magnetoresistance showed a maximum upon annealing.", "Ni Zr multilayers with different modulation wavelengths, 1<\u03bb<60 nm, and thickness ratios r=dNiDzr=0.5 and 1, 2 were prepared by sputtering. Their properties were investigated with a torque meter, a VSM, FMR and X-ray diffraction. For the as-deposited films the relative volume of the amorphous phase increases with decreasing \u03bb. For dNi \u22643.7 nm the films are entirely amorphous. At the first stage of annealing at 480 K, the value of 4\u03c0Meff=4\u03c0Ms - Hu of Ni sublayers, as measured by FMR, strongly decreases which implies the onset of the perpendicular anisotropy.", "Sputtered magnetic Tb Fe multilayers (eTb=1.0 nm and 1.9 nm, 0.2\u2264eFe\u22642.4 nm) have been studied by X-ray diffraction, M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometry and magnetization measurements in the temperature range 4\u2013300 K. The results are in agreement with a composition modulation in the multilayers, with appearance of pure amorphous iron at the centre of iron layers from eFe value depending on eFe. Irradiation experiments on samples provide evidence for the change in magnetic properties related to the mixing of layers.", "A series of Pt/Co (111)-oriented multilayer thin films were sputter-deposited under a number of deposition conditions to promote differences in the structure of the films. The defect density, grain boundary structure, layering and quality of texture were found to depend on the choice of sputtering pressure and gas, namely, Ar, Ar/Xe, or Xe. These differences were correlated to the magnetic and magneto-optic properties of the films. Of major interest were the effects of microstructure on the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and magnetic coercivity. It is found that the observed coercivity correlates well with the grain boundary structure. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy on the other hand is better correlated with the quality of the layering. The roles of the stacking defect density, quality of the (111) texture, and the effects of grain shape on the perpendicular anisotropy are discussed as well.", "The crystalline structure of epitaxially grown Fe/Cr and Co/Ag superlattices is investigated by comparing the information derived from X-ray diffraction with information derived from a microscopic technique like perturbed angular correlation (PAC). We illustrate the usability and sensitivity of the PAC technique to discriminate the possible structural phases and to probe the magnetisation by measuring the magnitude and orientation of the hyperfine fields.", "Ferromagnetic resonance has been used to investigate the magnetic anisotropy in thin films of cobalt and Co/ZnO multilayers deposited by MOCVD. In general, the samples exhibited an overall in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the strength of which decreased with decreasing cobalt layer thickness. A buffer layer of ZnO was found to decrease the strength of the anisotropy with respect to a film of the same thickness deposited onto glass. In some relatively thin single films, two resonance modes were observed. This was also the case in multilayers deposited onto a ZnO buffer layer. The origins of these modes are discussed.", "An attempt is made to correlate the effective magnetic anisotropy of sputtered CoNi/Pt multilayers to the average stress in the thin film. It was found that compressive film stress decreases the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.", "X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopic studies were undertaken to characterize various magnetic phases observed prior to and during in-situ annealing of Fe\ue5f8N films deposited on glass substrates by reactive rf-biased sputtering techniques. The concentration of nitrogen in the films was controlled by altering the nitrogen flow rate (R) during reactive sputtering. Experiments were carried out on three films prepared with R = 2, 5 and 8 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm). The films contain an \u03b1-Fe phase saturated with nitrogen atoms and a martensite phase supersaturated with nnitrogen atoms in the as-deposited state. The increase in the value of R in film deposition results in a very small change in the lattice parameter of the \u03b1-Fe phase, but allows the martensite phase to progressively increase supersaturation with nitrogen atoms. The sample prepared at R = 2 sccm, upon annealing at temperatures ranging between room temperature (RT) and 500\u00b0C, showed no structural changes. Annealing of the samples prepared at R = 5 and 8 sccm also exhibited no structural changes between RT and 400\u00b0C, but showed some new phases when heated to 500\u00b0C. The sample for R = 5 sccm contained a Fe16N2 phase, while the sample for R = 8 sccm contained Fe16N2 and Fe4N phase. During annealing, the grain size for the samples increased from 10\u201330 nm at RT to 60\u201390 nm at 500\u00b0C. The phases formed at 500\u00b0C in all samples were stable and remained unchanged when the specimens were cooled to room temperature.", "A film with metal-like conductivity is prepared by the sputtering of polychlorotrifluoroethylene and sodium fluoride in radio-frequency plasma. Temperature-dependent resistivity of the film decreases proportionally from 8.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 (at 300 K) to 6.3 \u00d7 10\u22125\u03bc cm (at 5 K). Magnetic susceptibility of the film belongs to a Pauli paramagnetic group. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the amorphous structure of the film. UV-Vis, vibrational and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies suggest that the film consists of halogenated carbons and silicons constructing the conjugated structures.", "R2M14B (R = rare earth element; M = Fe or Co) is a main constituent of R-M-B permanent magnet alloys. Magnetization curves of single crystal samples and sintered alloys were measured in high fields with a hybrid magnet. The results for Nd2(Fe1-xCox)14B single crystals and sintered Pr17Fe75B8 alloy are reported in detail.", "Superconducting Bi-Pb-Ca-Sr-Cu-O oxides have been produced by the rapid thermal melt quenching method. The Tc(\u03f1mid\u00b7) and Tco(\u03f1=0) of the as-melted glass sample sintered at 855\u00b0C for 24 hours in air were 110 K and 105 K, respectively. The specimen has a large diamagnetic shielding effect and high intragrain critical current density [Jc(5K) \u2248 107 A/cm2 at low field] compared with the conventional ceramic-sintered materials. The de Almeida-Thouless phase line (irreversibility line) H\u2217(T) is obtained by hysteresis curves.", "Superconducting spin-glass multilayers of Nb and CuMn have been fabricated by using a sputtering deposition technique. In such a system critical temperatures, strongly dependent on the thickness of the spin-glass, have been observed. This behavior could be tentatively explained in terms of a pair breaking parameter related to both the proximity effect and the magnetic interaction.", "Magnetization curves on granular samples of oxide superconductor BaPb1-xBixO3 show hysteretic behavior well below the lower critical magnetic field Hc1. M(H) curves contain two linear segments and can be described satisfactorily by two parameters - characteristic magnetic fields. The effect of temperature and sintering time on M(H) curve parameters is discussed.", "In previous work we studied the magnetic response of sintered YBaCuO tubes to a step magnetic field excitation applied parallel to the axis. This phenomenon was characterized by a delay time \u03b4t, and an exponential time constant \u03c4, both decreasing functions of the applied pulse amplitude. Here we present the relationship existing among these two time-domain parameters and the complex ac susceptibility \u03c7 = \u03c7\u2032+i\u03c7\u2033. These results lead us to a frequency and field dependence of \u03c7 in good agreement with experimental and theoretical results from the harmonic analysis reported by several authors. Moreover we present results at higher frequencies than those usually available in ac measurements.", "Resistive (R(B,T)) transitions for both PbMo6S8 (PMS) and SnMo6S8 (SMS) compounds were measured in applied magnetic fields. For both compounds, the pseudo upper critical field Bc2\u2217(T) lines determined at different constant resistance criteria show a deviation from the expected thermodynamic Bc2(T). The deviation is more pronounced in the PMS sample which has a smaller coherence length. The activation energy barriers Ub(B) extracted from the Arrhenius plots of resistivity are lower for PMS (Ub(9T) = 1570 K) and for SMS (Ub(9T) = 2250 K).", "Two-dimensional structures produced by a new magnetron discharge\u2014a transversely magnetized a.c. discharge using completely inclined targets\u2014are investigated by means of optical emission spectroscopy. When the transverse magnetic field is increased, a considerable increase in the argon line emission intensity and a spatial modification of the line emission profiles are observed. From these observations it is found that when the cathode sheath width becomes less than the gap distance between the electrodes, electrons go around the target with infinite orbital motion, forming a high density electron ring. These new magnetron effects are available for increasing the deposition rate of large area sputter coating and/ or chemical vapour deposition. Further, by modulating the transverse magnetic field, the uniformity of the deposited copper films is confirmed to be much improved.", "For the purpose of low temperature, high speed coating fine wire such as a heavy metal fluoride optical fibre, we have developed a new plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition method using quadrupole electrodes. We have investigated fundamental discharge characteristics in a 10% CH4\ue5f8H2 gas and measured the substrate temperature using the temperature dependence of the electrical resistance to verify the low temperature process. The substrate temperature could be kept below the glass transformation temperature of about 300 \u00b0C by cooling the electrodes. A magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the discharge electric field to increase the neutral radical species which were generated by collision with electrons (the magnetron effect). Then the CH\u2217 optical emission intensity from the centre of the quadrupole electrodes has a maximum value for some value of the magnetic flux density. The trial preparation of an amorphous carbon thin film on an optical fibre was successfully performed. The above results are very useful to obtain low temperature, high speed coating on fibre materials.", "Thin films of amorphous hydrogenated silicon-carbon alloys of different compositions were deposited onto silicon and glass substrates by electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition using silane and methane as gas precursors. Growth rate dependences were studied for different [CH] [CH 4 + SiH 4] gas flow ratios. The films were characterized by optical transmission spectroscopy in the 200\u20132600 nm wavelength range, Fourier transform IR transmission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Optical parameters (refractive indices, absorption and extinction coefficients and optical band gap) were extracted from transmission spectra. The refractive index (at wavelength 1300 nm) was found to be between 3.2 and 2.0, and the optical band gap was in the range 1.75 to 2.3 eV, depending on experimental conditions.", "Sputter-deposited magnetostrictive films present an interesting opportunity to realize actuators in microsystems, as they offer features like contactless high-frequency operation, simple actuator designs and a cost-effective manufacturing technique. Amorphous magnetostrictive films of the binary compound SmFe as well as of the ternary compound TbDyFe have been prepared by d.c. magnetron sputtering using either a multitarget arrangement with pure element targets or cast composite-type targets. Depending upon the composition and the sputtering conditions, particularly upon the bias voltage, amorphous films with a giant magnetostriction of about 250 ppm (\u2212220 ppm) at 0.1 T and 440 ppm (\u2212300 ppm) at 0.5 T for TbDyFe (SmFe) and an adjustable magnetic easy axis can be prepared. In view of their applications in microsystem technologies (e.g., pumps, valves, positioning elements), these films have been tested in cantilever arrangements. The design of the actuators, such as the lateral patterning of the magnetostrictive films, has been modulated by means of finite-element calculations. For double-clamped beams or clamped membranes, these calculations reveal that lateral patterning of the magnetostrictive films is essential in order to obtain large deflections.", "Magnetic properties and field modulated microwave absorption have been studied on epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7 thin films prepared by MOCVD. Possible correlations between the irreversibility line and the properties of harmonics of the modulation field frequency in the reflected microwave power are discussed.", "Plasma carbonitriding, Zn metal coating via the chemical vapor deposition of Zn(C2H5)2 and high pressure sintering were studied as new processing routes to prepare Sm2Fe17Mx (M \u2261 C and/or N) material with good magnetic properties. Two reactions of carbiding and nitriding for Sm2Fe17 simultaneously took place by glow discharges under differential pumping conditions of mixed gases in the ternary system CH4 + N2 + H2. The compound with chemical formula Sm2Fe17C>xNy (x + y \u2248 3) was produced by a plasma reaction at 723 K, and the coercivity value was increased to around 11 kOe after the ball milling treatment up to a particle size of about 3 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the surface coating of Sm2Fe17CxNy with the Zn metal derived by the decomposition of Zn(C2H5)2 showed good oxidation resistivity and much more enhancement of the coercive force. The high pressure sintering of Zn/Sm2Fe17CxNy provided the magnetic molding materials free from the \u03b1-Fe phase.", "The ternary Fe-rich R\ue5f8Fe\ue5f8T alloys and their nitrides related to the tetragonal ThMn12-type structure have been considered as potential candidates as permanent magnet materials with intermediate energy product values (BH)max \u2248 10\u201312 MGOe. Enhancement of their intrinsic properties has been achieved either with nitrogenation and/or reduction of the transition (T) element. We present here thermodynamic, structural and magnetic properties studies of the series RFe12\u2212xTx, where 0.5 \u2a7d x \u2a7d 1.0, R \u2261 Pr and T \u2261 Mo. By reducing the concentration of Mo, the magnetization increases to an appreciable level (over 125 emu g\u22121 at room temperature) with an increase in the anisotropy field, reaching a maximum at x = 1.0. We also report some data on the deposition of these materials in the form of thin films produced by magnetron sputtering. According to the conditions of preparation, in-plane and/or out-of-plane perpendicular anisotropy has been observed in the NdFe11TiNx films on Si and Ta substrates.", "The compound CoN was prepared as a single phase by the d.c. reactive sputtering. Its crystal structure determined by X-ray diffraction measurements is the zinc blende type f.c.c. structure. The compound CoN is stable up to 504 K and decomposes into CoN+\u03b4-Co2N above 509 K. This compound exhibits a Pauli paramagnetic character.", "Six metal hydrides relevant for practical applications (four AB5 alloys, one AB2 alloy and Mg(Ni)) were thermally cycled at constant volume under a hydrogen gas atmosphere. Up to 64 000 absorption-desorption cycles have been completed so far (with LaNi4.7Al0.3). The respective reversible hydrogen capacities as a function of the number of cycles were determined for the selected cycling conditions. Regeneration conditions were determined when applicable. Various investigations (pressure-composition isotherms, thermal desorption spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffractometry, magnetization, laser granulometry, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray analysis) were performed in order to determine the degradation and regeneration mechanisms involved. The reversible storage capacity of the AB5 alloys decayed during cycling. This effect is stronger at higher temperatures and pressures. However, the original capacity of all four materials could be recovered by heating to about 400\u2013500 \u00b0C in vacuum. Disproportionation was found to be the degradation mechanism for the AB5 alloys. The AB2 alloy showed no degradation after 42 400 cycles. Mg(Ni) degrades as a consequence of a reduction of the comparatively slow absorption kinetics probably caused by sintering of the original powder.", "Zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) thin films have been grown by photo-metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (photo-MOCVD) and also MOCVD onto n-type ZnSe single crystal aiming at p-Zn3P2/n-ZnSe solar cells. A good diode characteristic was observed in p-Zn3P2/n-ZnSe heterojunctions fabricated with annealing in hydrogen at 400\u00b0C. An open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.4\u20130.5 V, a fill factor of 0.6, and a short-circuit current of 2\u20139 \u03bcA/cm2 were obtained under simulated air mass 1.5 illumination without anti-reflective coating. One of the reason with this small short-circuit current is the high resistivity and ohmic contact problem of ZnSe. A spectral response of Voc indicates a good band-pass behavior of the heterojunction between 1.5 and 2.7 eV, which are bandgaps of Zn3P2 and ZnSe, respectively.", "Pb2KNb5O15 ferroelectric ceramics have been elaborated. In order to obtain the exact stoichiometric composition two processes were used: sintering either in open air with an excess of PbO or in a closed alumina vessel in a PbO-rich atmosphere. The two types of obtained ceramics show dielectric properties close to those of single crystals. Furthermore, the crystallographic and dielectric data indicate that the best chemical homogeneity has been obtained using the closed system. The high dielectric constant results from two contributions: a MHz-GHz relaxation of the intrinsic polarization and a low-frequency dispersion of the space charge polarization.", "Class C flyash, baghouse dust and scrubber sludge have been successfully used for sulphoaluminate belite (SAB) cement preparation by microwave sintering. For proper raw mix proportioning, the modulus of gehlenite (C2AS)11Conventional cement notation is used here, i.e. C=CaO, S=SiO2, etc. formation (MG) and modulus of calcium sulphosilicate (2C2S\u00b7CS\u0304) formation (MS) were put forward. The results indicated that, when MG and MS were 0.90\u20131.10, C2AS and 2C2S\u00b7CS\u0304 could be chemically eliminated when microwave-sintered at low temperature; with the 1150\u00b0C/10 min sintering condition, microwave-prepared sample had developed into SAB cement clinker with the main phases of C4A3S and \u03b2-C2S, while a conventionally fired one had not; with proper gypsum addition, microwave-prepared SAB cement developed strength similar to Type-I cement in 28-day hydration.", "Systems consisting of magnetic particles embedded in a silica matrix have been used in magnetic recording, their study being thus an actual theme of research. In this work, we report some of the main results of a systematic study conducted to determine properties of the magnetic phases of the system Co2SiO4. The study also deals with the magnetic parameters of the composites Co2O3\u2013SiO2, in an attempt to establish relationships between structural environment and the magnetic properties. Polycrystalline sintered samples were prepared using a chemical route, structurally and magnetically measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy and magnetometry. For applied magnetic fields of the order of tens of Oersteds, the system has ferromagnetic (F) order, whereas for fields of a few thousands of Oersteds, a frustated antiferromagnetic (AF) response is detected. Our measurements detect the existence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Also, crystalline Co2SiO4 is shown to have uniaxial anisotropy, detected by magnetization versus field curves.", "We present results from standard and electrically detected magnetic resonance on nanocrystalline silicon from hot-wire and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition for which the Raman spectra showed the same large crystalline fraction. Based on the fact that dangling bond spin density scales with the sub-band gap absorption coefficient at photon energies 1.1 eV we suggest the introduction of a calibration factor between the dangling bond spin density and the absorption coefficient. The photocarrier mobility\u2013lifetime product and diffusion length increase with decreasing dangling bond spin density and absorption coefficient. The electrically detected magnetic resonance spectra shows no signal in the dark current and a single line when measured by the spin-dependent photocurrent. The experimentally determined g-value of this line is temperature dependent. The quantum-mechanical spin-pair model explains the electrically detected magnetic resonance signal height. From the spin-pair model we determine microscopic parameters, e.g. singlet-decay rate.", "Silicon nanometer sized dot multilayers have been prepared by repeating low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) for dot formation and thermal oxidation for dot isolation. The multilayers show efficient photoluminescence after annealing at 1000\u00b0C, which reduces Si dangling bond density measured by electron spin resonance (ESR). The measured luminescence peak energy shifts from 1.25 to 1.64 eV as the dot height decreases from 15 to 1 nm. The optical bandgap measured by photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) has a blue shift from 2.0 to 2.7 eV when the dot height changes from 6 to 1 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) efficiency for both single-layered and multilayered dots increases by two orders of magnitude as the dot height decreases from 15 to 5 nm and becomes constant for dots smaller than 5 nm. These results indicate that the luminescence is not caused by the band-to-band transition, but caused by the recombination through radiative centers existing in the Si/SiO2 interface region.", "Li-modified polycrystalline samples of La-modified PZT (PLZT), Pb0.91(La1\u2212z/3Li z )0.09(Zr0.65Ti0.35)0.9775O3 with z=0.5 and 0.7 were synthesised through a sol\u2013gel route. The gels were dried and calcined at different temperatures. The formation of a single phase compound was confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies. The cold pressed pellets of the mixed compounds were sintered at different temperatures. The effect of sintering on the dielectric properties of the Li-modified compound has been reported here.", "Properties of oxygenated carbon nitride films have attracted the attention of physics researchers due to their magnetic and physical properties, as well as for their usefulness in the industry. The free radicals were investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance applied in the study of spin concentration due to the different mechanism of preparation of carbon nitride films by RF-discharge with different kinds of plasma. Unpaired spin concentrations, in the order of 1020 per cm3, were measured and their time recombination dependency was important in those films. The films were grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition using mixtures of hydrocarbons, N2 and O2 in different proportions.", "The incorporation of oxygen during the preparation of sputtered CdTe films produces a strong strain of the zincblende (cubic) lattice. First as a consequence of this, the energy band-gap shifts to lower energies and then, for larger strains, the degeneracy of the hole valence bands splits into two bands at the fundamental band-gap. These two transitions were measured using photoreflectance spectroscopy (PRS) as a function of the oxygen content. The energy band-gap shift resulting from tensile stress in the films was calculated using the elastic constants and deformation potentials for CdTe as well as the measured interplanar spacing values of the (111) CdTe X-ray diffraction peak.", "The influence of the cobalt substitution for manganese ions in the series of the perovskites Pr0.8Na0.2Mn(1\u2212x)CoxO3 (0\u2a7dx\u2a7d0.1) was investigated. The study of electric and magnetic properties was carried out on sintered polycrystalline samples. The composition of x=0.04 exhibits an insulator to metal-like (I\u2013M) transition at \u223c106K, connected with a ferromagnetic arrangement. For x=0.1, however, an insulating behavior persists down to low temperatures in spite of the transition to the bulk ferromagnetism. The observed properties are related to an acting of the cobalt ions as point defects. They disturb the tendency to charge ordering and instead of the antiferromagnetic arrangement typical for x=0 ferromagnetic double-exchange interactions Mn3+\u2013O2\u2212\u2013Mn4+ and Mn3.5+\u03b4\u2013O2\u2212\u2013Co2+, decisive for the resulting behavior, arise.", "In the present work, the structure, magnetic properties and magnetoresistance effect of Ni1\u2212xMnxFe2O4 (x=0,0.2,0.4,0.8) sintered ferrites are studied. Results indicate that these ferrites crystallize in the cubic spinel structure. Curie temperature decreases but the saturation magnetization increases with increasing Mn content in Ni1\u2212xMnxFe2O4 sintered ferrites. A large magnetoresistance effect has been found in samples x=0.4 and x=0.8.", "The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of different substrate effects, when magnetron sputtering is used to sputter CoCrTa/Cr layers on different plastic (PET: polyethylene terephthalate) substrates, on kapton and on glass. Four substrate effects were investigated: the kind and thickness of the plastic, the shape of the substrate holder, the influence of a heat conducting glue during sputtering and the target\u2013substrate distance. The best results were obtained using thin PET, with a target\u2013substrate distance of 4cm. This is due to an easier heat transfer using the thin substrate. A heat conducting glue stabilizes the sputter process. By using a cylindrical sample holder we studied the transformability of our sputter process to an industrial roll coater process. The magnetic parameters were almost constant over the whole sample. All films are characterized by hysteresis, remanence, X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy measurements.", "The applicability of Tougaard's method of a \u201cuniversal\u201d form of background correction in photoelectron spectra was investigated for thin films of the wide gap insulators YbFx, DyFx, SmFx, and YFx. These films were produced by ion assisted deposition with varying fluorine content x\u2a7d3, caused by preferential sputtering. For YbFx, in particular, acceptable accuracy was obtained for x\u2a7e2.4 by shifting the universal background function by the band gap energy, while for x<2.4, no reasonable fit of the experimental background could be obtained. More realistic profiles of the inelastic scattering background were calculated on the basis of published fast-electron energy-loss data of DyF3, which yielded highly accurate quantification of spectra of YbFx in the whole range of x between 2 and 3. This was confirmed by measurements of the intensity ratios of the 4f peaks of Yb2+ and Yb3+, representing valence states 2 and 3, respectively, which are directly correlated with the fluorine content. Stoichiometry values from XPS data were compared with Rutherford backscattering analysis and yielded good agreement.", "We report on near surface electronic defects generated through 5 keV Ar+ ion beam sputtering on (110) oriented freshly cleaved surfaces of CdTe, CdSeyTe1\u2212y and ZnxCd1\u2212x Te that are of importance in the context of exactly lattice matched substrates with HgxCd1\u2212xTe. The alloys have been analyzed by means of photoreflectance and low temperature photoluminescence measurements. The interaction of the impinging Ar+ ions with the solid leads to local stoichiometric disturbances establishing a drastically increased number of electronic defects, located energetically within the band gap. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals significant differences for the alloys exhibiting substitution on the cation and anion sublattice, respectively. For instance, upon Ar+ ion sputtering Cd1\u2212xZnxTe reveals a dramatic increase of the deep luminescence band typically observed for this material. In contrast, we find a dominent shallow defect for CdSeyTe1\u2212y. The experimental data indicate, that the Ar+ ion induced damage extends to a much larger depth than the projected range of \u2248 60 \u00c5 for the penetrating Ar+ iosn.", "Lead zirconate titanate thin films have been deposited on platinized silicon substrate at low temperature by reactive facing target sputtering. The effects of substrate temperature, total gas pressure, sputtering ambience, input power and target composition on the phase composition of PZT thin film were investigated. By controlling the sputtering conditions, highly (111) oriented perovskite PZT thin films can be obtained, and the samples show ferroelectric properties.", "Boron nitride under equilibrium conditions crystallizes in the sp2 bonded graphite like structure and therefore shows no solubility with aluminum nitride or the other group III nitrides. An incorporation of BN into the wurtzite lattice of AlN could extend the applications of (Al,Ga,In)N films due to a higher variability concerning band gap and lattice parameters. To investigate the regions of metastable solid solubility between AlN and BN, ternary films with compositions along the quasibinary section AlN-BN have been deposited on Si(111) wafers at substrate temperatures of 100 and 600\u00b0C by means of reactive magnetron sputtering. The structure and texture of the films have been analyzed by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) after the transfer of the films in a lock chamber under high vacuum into the analysis chamber. In the same device, the composition and binding states were measured by photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, XAES). The lattice parameters of the films have been determined using X-ray diffraction with a grazing incidence attachment (GIXRD). The results show that it has been possible to deposit by reactive magnetron sputtering metastable single-phase (Al,B)N films in the sp3 bonded wurtzite structure of AlN with BN contents of at least 33 mol.%. The films are strongly textured with different [h0l] textures for deposition at 100\u00b0C substrate temperature and [001] textures at 600\u00b0C. The crystallinity, especially of the BN rich films, increases with higher temperatures.", "A new plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique, referred to as closed chamber CVD (CC-CVD), is presented. It is based on a process, which alternates the deposition of an ultra-thin layer and modification at equilibrium conditions within a temporarily closed reactor chamber. Results on the preparation of highly crystalline \u03bcc-Si:H films at an increased growth rate are presented. An emphasis is given to the specific opportunities of CC-CVD to control the structural details of the \u03bcc-Si/H material. Efficient p-type doping of ultra-thin \u03bcc-Si:H layers was also demonstrated. Phase-pure a-SiC/H films \u2014 with carbon dominantly bonded in a Si\u2013C configuration \u2014 are also prepared by CC-CVD. They simultaneously have a large band gap and a high conductivity. Because of the enhanced capability of CC-CVD to control the structure of the deposited films, it is an appropriate technique for the synthesis of various Si-based thin film materials for application in large area electronics.", "Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thin films were epitaxially grown on MgO(100) and SrTiO3(100) single crystal substrates and on YBa2Cu3O7(001) (YBCO) sublayers by employing reactive inverted cylindrical magnetron sputtering. The Pb content and Zr/Ti ratio of the PZT films were analyzed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry as a function of the deposition temperature and the sputtering pressure. The film orientation perpendicular to and in the substrate plane and the respective mosaic spreads were determined by X-ray diffraction. The electrical insulation and the temperature- and frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity of the PZT films were studied on ferroelectric capacitors. The largest remanent polarization of 61 \u03bcC/cm2 at 77 K was obtained for films with the correct Pb stoichiometry and the highest degree of epitaxy. Three degradation effects of PZT capacitors with Au top and YBCO bottom electrodes, namely fatigue, loss of retention and aging, were also investigated. The fatigue tests revealed a rather poor endurance of the capacitors. The loss of retention and aging, however, were negligible at an operational temperature of 77 K. Ferroelectric polarization charging effects were observed in YBCO films thinner than 20 nm. While the resistance modulation of 4% and its polarity dependence were consistent with a charging effect and the p-type conduction in YBCO, the modulation of the critical current density of 3% was significantly smaller than expected from the polarization switching of PZT.", "A layer-by-layer hydrogen plasma annealing method was used to fabricate hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films in plasma chemical vapor deposition system by using methane and hydrogen as the reactant gases. The influences of hydrogen annealing conditions on the structures and photoluminescence behavior were systematically investigated. It was found that the photoluminescence (PL) properties of a-C:H films were strongly affected by the hydrogen plasma annealing process. The PL characteristics are believed to relate to the film network relaxation rather than the change of the optical band gap. Two intense PL bands, which were located at both the green and blue-violet regions, were observed at room temperature. For some annealed a-C:H films, the resonant features were observed in photoluminescence excitation spectra, which is consistent with the exciton-like recombination model.", "We have improved the quality of our narrow bandgap a-SiGe:H grown by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) by decreasing our W filament diameter and our substrate temperature. We now grow a-SiGe:H with Tauc bandgaps below 1.5 eV having a photoresponse equal to or better than our plasma enhanced CVD grown alloys. We enhanced the transport properties\u2014as measured by the photoconductivity frequency mixing technique\u2014relative to previous HWCVD results. These improved alloys do not necessarily show an improvement in the degree of structural heterogeneity on the nanometer scale as measured by small-angle X-ray scattering. Decreasing both the filament temperature and substrate temperature produced a film with relatively low structural heterogeneity while photoluminescence showed an order of magnitude increase in defect density for a similar change in the process.", "CoCrTa/Cr thin films were deposited on NiP/AlMg and glass substrates by a DC magnetron sputtering method with a DC substrate bias voltage ranging from 0\u2013500 V. The changes of magnetic properties, orientation of grains and the composition of CoCrTa were investigated. Three different kinds of biasing schemes were used. In group A, the substrates were biased during Cr underlayer deposition and the subsequent CoCrTa layers were deposited without bias. In group B, Cr underlayers were deposited without bias and the subsequent substrates were biased during the CoCrTa layer deposition. In group C, the two layers were biased. In all cases, coercivity increased to a maximum value at the bias voltage of 300 V and decreased with further increasing the bias voltage. When the Cr underlayer was deposited on mechanically textured (scratched) NiP substrates with the substrate biased condition, smaller and more uniform column size distribution were obtained and clear texture lines were observed in comparison to the unbiased specimens. The smaller Cr column size subsequently induces smaller Co grains. This may be main cause of the coercivity increase in the group A specimens. When the CoCrTa layer was deposited with higher bias voltage, the composition of the film changes due to different resputtering rate and Cr segregation is more enhanced. These two effects are contributing to the increase of the CoCrTa coercivity. Orientation ratio (OR) of Hc in circumferential and radial direction was also studied as a function of the bias voltage. The origin of coercivity OR was also discussed.", "Metal incorporated carbon films (Me-C:H) were deposited using a new technique with two W screen grids incorporated inside an electron cyclotron resonance chemical vapour deposition (ECR-CVD) chamber. This technique is versatile when applied to the deposition of Me-C:H films as the degree of plasma ionisation, the sputtering rate of the metal grids and the energy of the impinging ions can be independently controlled. In this work, the proposed technique is demonstrated through W-C:H deposition at different flow ratios of CH4 to Ar. A DC bias of \u2212330V was applied to the upper and lower grids with either the substrate floating or under direct DC bias. The films were characterised in terms of their conductivity, atomic concentration (RBS), atomic configuration(XPS and XRD), hardness and optical absorption. The resistivities and the optical gaps of the films were noted to decrease drastically upon incorporation of several atomic percentage of W. WC formation is only observed for films deposited with the substrate under direct DC bias.", "The angular dependence of the sputtering coefficient is studied experimentally and by numerical simulation for nickel crystals in the temperature range from 50\u00b0C to 400\u00b0C, including the Curie point. The difference in the sputtering of Ni in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states is found to depend on the angle of ion incidence. This difference, caused by a change in the interaction potential of the atoms during the magnetic phase transition, turns out to be greatest for oblique incidence and for incidence near open channel directions of the crystal lattice. In these cases, the atoms are emitted as a result of longer chains of collisions, increasing the cumulative effect of the change in interaction potential at the magnetic phase transition.", "Low pressure sputtering with controlled ratio of ion flux to deposited atom flux at the condensing surface is one of the main directions of development of magnetron sputtering methods. In this paper comparative analysis of three configurations of the magnetron sputtering system has been made. The following parameters, which serve as criteria for the estimation of unbalanced magnetron parameters have been developed: the unbalance coefficient (K) and the coefficient of geometrical unbalance (KG), which characterise the field configuration at the front of a target. These parameters can be determined by numerical simulation of the magnetic field distribution and the relation between them is characterised by arranging magnetron parameters. Their dependence on the distribution of ion current drawn at the substrate is determined which, taking into account distribution of deposited material, allows calculation of the ion-to-atom ratio on the surface of the condensing material and its dependence on the level of magnetron unbalance. It was determined that the unbalance coefficient K was almost proportionally related to the ion-to-atom ratio for various magnetron types with the same sputtering zone. Also, comparative analysis of three of the magnetron configurations carried out showed that a magnetron with an additional electromagnetic coil is most suitable for low pressure sputtering. Decrease of working pressure down to 0.03Pa allowed the use of a closed-field configuration of magnetron with an independent ion source of the closed-drift type.", "Using highly conductive Al-doped ZnO (AZO) ceramic target, (002)-oriented transparent conductive AZO thin films are prepared by DC planar magnetron sputtering deposition on glass sheet substrate. Structural, electrical and optical properties of the films deposited at different temperatures and subsequently annealed at 400\u00b0C for 2h under 10\u22123Pa are characterized with various techniques. Experimental results show that the electrical resistivity of AZO thin films deposited at 320\u00b0C can be as low as 1.5\u00d710\u22124\u03a9cm with post-deposition annealing. The annealing process leads to improvement of (002) orientation, wider band gap, increased carrier concentration and blue shift of absorption edge in the transmission spectra of AZO thin films.", "In this letter, we report narrow band gap (1.39\u20131.53 eV) a-SiGe:H films with high photosensitivity (\u223c104\u2013105) are grown successfully by HW-CVD using a mixture of (GeH4+SiH4) at low flow rates and without hydrogen dilution with higher deposition rates (>10 \u00c5/s). These films are characterized by Raman spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and UV\u2013Visible spectroscopy. The band gap of a-SiGe:H films can be narrowed by increasing the germane gas fraction without apparent degradation in their electronic properties. The low hydrogen content in a-SiGe:H films indicates that the growth of a-SiGe:H films is mainly from the atomic species (Si, Ge and H) evaporated from the hot filament.", "Lead zirconate titanate [Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3, PZT] ceramics were prepared by a hybrid method of sol-gel and solid-state reaction. Reaction of the oxides to PZT occured at a temperature as low as 500 \u00b0C, which is believed to be induced by the PZT crystallized from the sol-gel portion in the system. Fully dense PZT ceramics with 99% of the theoretic density have been achieved from the partially reacted mixture at a sintering temperature of 1100 \u00b0C for 1 h. The good dielectric (K=1030, \u03b4=3%) and ferroelectric (Pr=24.3 \u03bcC/cm2, Ec=12 kV/cm) properties of the sintered PZT ceramic measured in the present work are in good agreement with the widely reported results of other processing techniques in the literature, indicating the practicality of the hybrid method for the preparation of PZT ceramics. It is also believed to be applicable to other materials that can be processed via sol-gel technique.", "A wet procedure to prepare stoichiometric and homogeneous Zr-rich PZT powders is described. The hydroxide precursor was prepared by coprecipitation from a mixed nitrate solution containing Pb2+, Zr4+, TiO2+ ions at pH 9. The precursor pellets were heated at 550 \u00b0C for 0.5 h and reaction sintered at 1130 \u00b0C for 2 h under hot press, then a density of 98% theoretical density was obtained, as well as the samples exhibited good ferroelectric properties.", "Long-term corrosion tests were performed on sintered magnets in an environment similar to their working conditions. It was found that the corrosion process proceeds faster for magnets containing higher Nd contents. A small degree of oxidation slows down the corrosion rate and improves the corrosion resistance. However, high oxidation of magnets leads to degradation of the microstructure and the magnetic properties during their subsequent service. Small oxygen contents, which improve the resistance to oxidation, do not affect the magnetic properties. The critical oxygen concentration, which causes deterioration of the properties, depends on both the Nd content and the solute elements added to the starting alloy. Additions of Co, Al, Zr, C or Cu substantially improve the resistance to atmospheric corrosion.", "We have recently reported an alternative technique for the generation of ordered nanometer quantum dots on III\u2013V semiconductor surfaces via self-organized patterning by ion sputtering [S. Facsko et al., Science 285 (1999) 1551]. Ripple formation induced by ion sputtering has been observed in a wide variety of materials under non-normal incidence. In contrast to this, normal incidence ion bombardment leads to the formation of uniform dots on GaSb surfaces ordered in a hexagonal array. The dots have a highly crystalline structure and an aspect ratio of 1. Due to the low energy of the ions, only the topmost 2 nm are damaged by the ion beam. The formation process of nanoscale dots is based on an instability that arises from the curvature dependence of the sputter yield. The interplay between this instability and surface smoothing mechanisms creates a surface morphology dominated by a single wavelength. Sputtering the stable surface structures down to an interface with a larger bandgap material below produces isolated quantum dots that show electrical confinement. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies are performed here to characterize the fabricated quantum dot structures.", "We have measured sputtering yields of electrically insulating oxides, i.e. amorphous SiO2, Yb-doped SrCeO3 and SrTiO3 in order to investigate the electronic excitation effects on ion-induced atomic displacements, applying a carbon (C)-film collector method. It is found that the sputtering yields are larger by a factor of \u223c1000 than the calculated sputtering yields due to the elastic collision cascade, indicating a huge contribution of the electronic excitation effects to the sputtering yields. It also appears that the sputtering yields scale with the square of the electronic excitation density and that the sputtering yields increase steeply with increasing the band gap of the oxides.", "Ion irradiation of amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide films introduces additional disorder into the films and leads to chemical modifications. These effects were monitored using Infrared, UV-visible optical and Raman spectroscopies. Samples were prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), then irradiated with 300 keV Ar+ to fluences ranging from 5\u00d71013 to 1\u00d71015 cm\u22122. The hydrogen concentration was determined by elastic recoil detection analysis using 2.0 MeV He+ beam.After ion irradiation, the absorption coefficient in the UV-visible energy range was observed to increase by an order of magnitude, while the optical energy gap decreases from 3.2 eV to 2.0 eV. These changes are due to the formation of carbon clusters, as evidenced by the carbon yield in Raman measurements. Infrared spectra indicate that this excess of carbon atoms results from the breaking of CHnbonds in the as-grown film and by a concomitant decrease in the hydrogen concentration. In addition, defects created by ion bombardment change the oscillator strength of the Si\u2013H vibrational modes.", "In the present study, the surface properties of homoepitaxially grown chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond have been investigated using total photoyield measurements, scanning tunneling microscope (STM) observations and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). The STM results show that as-grown CVD diamond(100) surfaces are characterized mainly by two types of regions with 2\u00d71/1\u00d72 structures and much less structures. These well-ordered surface structures can be significantly clearer after a low-temperature annealing at 150\u2013200\u00b0C in ultra high vacuum. On the other hand, the STS results indicate the presence of band gap states, which agrees well with the fact that the observed photoemission threshold energy is located at 5eV, well below the band gap energy of 5.5eV, for the as-grown CVD diamond surface. The absolute value measurements of the photoemission total yields using a calibrated Si photodetector demonstrate substantially low photoemission efficiencies even for negative electron affinity (NEA) diamond surfaces, being consistent with the STM/STS data.", "Epitaxial growth of La0.66Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) layers has been successfully achieved on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) substrates using RF magnetron sputtering with facing targets. The magnetic behavior of the films was analyzed before the structure was investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) performed on plan-view and cross-sectional specimens. We report the influence of the deposition conditions and nature of substrate on the growth and magnetic properties of the layers. The study of the relaxation mechanisms in the different specimens gives evidence for both epitaxial strain and rhombohedral distortion relaxation. Their occurrence strongly depends on the growth conditions, which in turn controls the oxygen stoichiometry in the samples and their magnetic properties.", "Electrochemically deposited Fe\u2013P magnetic thin film from acidic tartarate complex bath solution was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As-prepared film contains both Fe3+- and P5+-like species, whereas the same film after 10 and 20min sputtering shows peaks corresponding to Fe metal as well as P\u03b4\u2212 species along with P5+ species. The film after heat-treatment contains Fe3+ together with P5+ and P\u03b4\u2212 species, whereas heat-treated film after sputtering shows the presence of both Fe metal and Fe2+ species. There is an increase in P\u03b4\u2212 intensity on sputtering the heat-treated film.", "Zinc sulfide (ZnS) thin films with nano-scale grains of about 50nm were deposited on glass substrates at a substrate temperature of 200\u00b0C via RF reactive sputtering by using zinc plate target and hydrogen sulfide gas. The structure, compositions, electrical and optical characteristics of the deposited films were investigated for the photovoltaic device applications. All films showed a near stoichiometric composition as indicated in their AES data. Distinct single crystalline phase with preferential orientation along the (0001) plane of wurtzite or the (111) plane of zinc blende (ZB) was revealed in their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and the spacing of the planes are well matched to those of (112) plane of the chalcopyrite CuInS2 (CIS). UV-Vis measurement showed that the films had more than 65% transmittance in the wavelength larger than 350nm, and the fundamental absorption edge shifted to shorter wavelength with the increase of sulfur incorporated in the films, which corresponds to an increase in the energy band gap ranging from 3.59 to 3.72eV. It was found that ZnS films are suitable for use as the buffer layer of the CIS solar cells, and it is the viable alternative for replacing CdS in the photovoltaic cell structure.", "For the interfaces of CVD Si3N4 on Si(100) and directly-nitrided Si(100), chemical bonding features, energy band offsets and defect state density distributions have been studied using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and total photoelectron yield spectroscopy. At nitride\u2013Si(100) interfaces, Si\ue5f8N bonding states in which each Si atom is bonded with one or three N atoms are formed predominantly, being presumably related to the structural strain induced by Si\ue5f8N bonding at the interface. For nearly stoichiometric SiN x (x\u22651.3) in the thickness range of 1.0\u201317nm which was prepared by 750\u00b0C CVD or 700\u00b0C direct-nitridation, the energy band gap was determined to be 5.4\u00b10.1eV from the energy loss spectra of N 1s photoelectrons. By analyzing the valence band spectra of thin SiN x /Si(100) heterostructures, the valence band offset between such SiN x and Si(100) was obtained to be 1.9\u00b10.1eV. For the direct-nitridation of Si(100) at 600 or 700\u00b0C, an interface state density as low as \u223c1010 eV\u22121 cm\u22122 near Si midgap was confirmed by total photoelectron yield measurements.", "Studies of the photoelectrical and optical properties were done on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films in order to examine the possibility for construction of an efficient sensor for He\u2013Ne (632nm) laser light detection. Films with various thicknesses were prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on substrates of glass, molybdenum (Mo)-coated glass, and silicon (Si) wafer. Relationships between the a-Si:H film thickness and the optical properties, i.e. visible (VIS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, were given. The film\u2019s absorption coefficient at 632nm was deduced from its visible light transmission spectra. The quantum size effect, i.e. an increase of the light absorption efficiency with the decrease of the film thickness, was observed. The optical absorption could be related to the Tauc mechanism rather than the Cubic mechanism. The band gap (Eg) and photoconductivity of the film were dependent on the thickness. The latter was also influenced by the substrate material. The a-Si:H/substrate interface is an important factor for the variation of photoelectrical properties. The He\u2013Ne laser illumination appeared to induce more damages than the white light illumination based on the same amount of input energy. The optimal a-Si:H film thickness for the application was calculated. In summary, the photoelectric and optical properties of the PECVD a-Si:H film are adequate for the fabrication of the photosensor for the He\u2013Ne laser light detection.", "The effect of heat treatment on the intrinsic coercivity, iHc and microstructure were investigated for sintered (Nd,Dy)15(Fe,Co,Mo,Al)77 B8 permanent magnet. The microstructure has been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray spectroscopy and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. The observed behaviour of iHc may be caused by a superposition of the following effects: (i) the distribution of the nonmagnetic phases and the ratio of the amount of hard magnetic Nd2Fe14B-phase to the amount of the residual phases; (ii) homogeneous distribution of elements in the main phases; (iii) removing the stresses in the phases; and (iv) diffusion of Al, Mo and Co into the hard magnetic Nd2Fe14B-phases.", "Ultrafine hexagnoal ferrite Ba3Co2Fe24O41(Co2Z) powders were prepared by a citrate precursor method. Single Z-type phase was found to form at a relatively low temperature of 1150\u00b0C, and kept stable between 1150 and 1270\u00b0C. X-ray diffraction (XRD), TG, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), VSM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and XRF were used to characterize the powders. Co2Z ceramics with excellent magnetic properties can be obtained after sintering at 1150\u20131200\u00b0C. Microstructures as well as magnetic properties of the sintered bodies were investigated.", "A series of highly dense Ho-doped La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 (LCMO) bulk ceramic samples were processed in the temperature range 1450 to 1600\u00b0C and performed transport measurement (temperature down to 5K and magnetic field up to 7T). The effect of sintering time and temperature on transport properties are reported here. The magnetization and resistance decreased as sintering temperature is increased. Surface structure and morphology were studied by XRD, SEM and TEM. XRD pattern showed the monophasic orthorhombic structure of the sample sintered within the above temperature range for a sintering period of 20h. It is surprising and interesting to observe that at certain critical doping level transition temperature is increased significantly indicating its potential use in CMR-based device technology above room temperature. In this paper, we report that critical optimization of sintering parameter is very important to achieve enhanced transport and magnetic properties.", "The effects of doped bioactive glass (BG) on the structure and properties of sintered hydroxyapatite (HA) have been studied. The results showed that a calcination treatment at 900 \u00b0C increased the degree of crystallinity and the amount of hydroxyl group in HA, but resulted in the loss of a small amount of phosphorus. The addition of BG enhanced HA phase decomposition and hydroxyl group breakdown processes, decreased HA density and microhardness, increased indentation toughness in most cases, and promoted microcracking when sintered at high temperatures. The addition of BG could either strengthen or weaken HA, depending on the BG content and sintering condition. Practically, the optimal properties were obtained from the HA doped with 2.5 wt.% BG sintered at 1250 \u00b0C.", "Amorphous carbon nitride films have been synthesized on silicon using an electron cyclotron resonance chemical vapor deposition (ECR-CVD) system combined with a negative dc bias and a mixture of C2H2, N2 and Ar as precursors. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of the amorphous carbon nitride films are characterized by N&K analyzer. The optical band gap energy derived by Tauc's equation decays with increasing substrate negative dc bias, ECR-power, flow rate ratio of N2/C2H2, nitrogen to carbon ratio (N/C) determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and with the increase of graphitic content was examined by Raman spectroscopy.", "Plasma polymerized organic thin films were deposited at temperature in the range of room temperature to 693 K by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method using the thiophene (C4H4S) precursor. Radio frequency (RF) with 13.56 MHz was applied and the RF power was changed in the range from 30 to 100 W with a gas ratio of Ar:H2=1:1. The as-grown organic thin films were basically characterized with ellipsometry, UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. In order to compare the difference of optical properties of the plasma polymerized organic thin films, the effects of the RF power and deposition temperature on their structural properties were mainly studied in this work. UV\u2013Vis spectra showed an energy band gap shift from 3.78 to 4.02 eV with increasing RF power and quite high optical transmittance up to 95%. During CVD, moreover, the plasma diagnostics were in situ carried out by using optical emission spectroscopy that showed a strong dependency of intensity on RF powers. To check a possibility of optical device application, PL measurements were also carried out. From the PL data, we could obtain the maximum PL emission intensity at approximately 550 nm wavelength from a plasma polymerized organic thin film grown at room temperature and RF power of 70 W with gas ratio of Ar:H2=1:1. The maximum growth rate is obtained to be 115 nm/min.", "The interfacial microstructure between Ag/Pd electrodes and PMN\u2013PZN\u2013PT relaxor ferroelectric ceramics in cofired multilayer ceramic devices was investigated by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Disadvantageous interfacial defects, such as delaminations, warping, gas holes and exaggerated grain growth, were identified. In addition to the preparation process, the composition of the inner electrode paste and the sintering densification compatibility between the layers played important roles in the interfacial development. The relationship of the interfacial microstructure to the reliability of the device is discussed.", "The magnetic and transport properties of two series of sputtered [Ni80Co20(L)/Fe(t Fe)]Nmultilayers with different Fe layer thickness of t Fe=0.1 and 2nm, respectively, and varying L were studied and compared. An enhanced anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) peak around L=10nm was observed for annealed films with t Fe=0.1nm. The mechanism of AMR enhancement was discussed.", "A series of samples of nominally identical composition have been melt-quenched and thermomechanically deformed to varying degrees, resulting in a variation in crystallographic alignment. The effect of the alignment on the coercivity has been studied using measurements of the temperature dependence of coercivity. The analysis was performed using a well-known phenomenological model which relates the coercivity to the anisotropy field, through a parameter \u03b1, and the saturation magnetization, through an effective demagnetization coefficient Neff. It was discovered that the trends in \u03b1 and Neff as a function of crystallographic grain alignment are the opposite to what is expected and measured previously in analogous sintered samples of varying crystallographic alignment. An explanation for this behavior is proposed in which the evolving grain shape and grain boundary topography caused by deformation becomes the controlling factor in the coercivity rather than the crystallographic alignment of the grains.", "Quaternary CoCrPtNb thin films have been sputter-deposited and their magnetic and microstructural properties have been determined as a function of annealing. Coercivity, crystallography and magnetic interactions are shown to be dependent on composition and annealing conditions.", "The samples of Y3Fe(5\u2212x)AlxO12 (x=1,2,3,4,5) were sintered from corresponding mixed hydroxides that were obtained by coprecipitation of mixed nitrates. The neutron diffraction experiments were done, for all the samples, at 295 and 10K. All the samples crystallize in the garnet structure type. The iron and aluminum ions occupy tetrahedral and octahedral positions. The preferential distribution of these cations is found. The iron ions preferentially occupy octahedral positions, the smaller aluminum ions preferentially occupy the smaller tetrahedral positions. The samples with x=1, 2 are collinear ferrimagnetics, with antiparallel moments in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, at 10K. The sample with x=1 retains this magnetic order at 295K. The magnetically ordered phases were refined in the cubic space group Ia3d and in the rhombohedral space group R-3c. In the rhombohedral space group the magnetic moments of the iron ions at 10K are \u22123.94(6) and \u22123.6(1)\u03bcB in the tetrahedral position and 4.28(5) and 3.75(7)\u03bcB in the octahedral position, for samples with x=1,2, respectively. In the R-3c the total magnetic moment, per formula unit, agrees with the results of the classical magnetic measurements. Both samples (x=1,2) are rhombohedral at low temperatures and the symmetry of x=1 sample approaches the cubic with the increase of temperature.", "CoCrPt/CoCr/carbon films were sputter-deposited on CoTaZr soft-magnetic underlayers and the effects of a carbon intermediate layer on magnetic and recording properties were investigated by changing a heating sequence in sample preparations. A heating process before a CoCr deposition was needed to obtain a high perpendicular coercivity. The carbon diffusion into a CoCr layer during its deposition led to small crystal grains in the CoCr layer and thereby the CoCrPt layer. Consequently, a high perpendicular coercivity was obtained, which was considered due to the change in magnetization process from a wall motion to a coherent rotation. The use of a thin (1\u20135nm) carbon intermediate layer was found to be effective to obtain both low noise and high resolution.", "The effect of exchange field Hex on media properties and the dependence of Hex on composition of stabilizing layers and sputtering process in SF media have been examined. It is revealed that to increase Hex, it is necessary to increase the saturation magnetization of the ferromagnetic layers and to reduce the interface roughness.", "Magnetisation reversal and magnetoresistance of sputtered Ni83Fe17/Au/Co/Au multilayers with Co layer thicknesses 0.2\u2a7dtCo\u2a7d1.5nm were studied. Depending on tCo, the Co layers are superparamagnetic (tCo<0.3nm), ferromagnetic with discontinuous (0.3\u2a7dtCo<0.6nm) or continuous (tCo\u2a7e0.6nm) layer structure and, for tCo\u2a7d1.2nm, show perpendicular anisotropy.", "Results of detailed magnetization study on ion-beam sputtered films of disordered Cr70Fe30 and Cr75Fe25 alloys of varying thickness reveal strong departure from the bulk behaviour even for a film as thick as d=470nm; at this thickness, the Curie temperature T C has dropped by roughly a factor of 2. In the range 9.4nm\u2a7dd\u2a7d470nm, T C \u03b1d\u22121 . This is contrary to Fe or Cr thin films where intrinsic magnetic properties vary with d only for ultra-low thicknesses. Film stress in combination with a high degree of inherent chemical disorder, long-range ferromagnetic and antiferromagetic exchange interactions are thought to dominate variations of magnetic properties in the intermediate film thickness range. Hysteresis effects alone cannot account for the re-entrant spin glass-like behaviour observed at temperatures T\u2aa1T C.", "We report on the structural, transport and magnetic properties of Co20Cu80 metallic granular films. The granular films are prepared by ion-beam sputtering at room temperature on glass substrates. The structural properties have been investigated using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Structural characterisation confirmed that the samples consist of fine magnetic particles embedded in the non-magnetic Cu matrix. Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) of 3% is observed at room temperature after annealing at 250\u00b0C for 30min. Detailed structural analysis is performed to understand the origin of the small GMR signal. It is confirmed that this result is directly correlated to the small size, density, and non-uniform distribution of Co particles.", "We have synthesized for the first time the new granular system Fe\u2013MoOx(2\u2a7dx\u2a7d3) by using a sputtering technique. The magnetic measurements reveal that the granular films exhibit superparamagnetism and the interface of the iron granules is oxidized partially. Negative magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures for the Fe\u2013MoOx(x\u223c2) granular thin films synthesized under reducing atmosphere. The behavior of the negative magnetoresistance strongly depends on the ratio of the Fe to the MoOx . It is suggested that the electronic conduction is mainly due to the spin-dependent tunneling through the oxidized interface between the granules and the matrix.", "The dependence of the magnetic anisotropy of amorphous iron silicide thin films with Si concentration has been investigated. Their anisotropy energies had values above 104erg/cm3 with coercive fields below 1Oe. Their easy magnetic axis was always contained in the plane of the substrate. Their orientation in the plane changed depending on the Si atom concentration. EXAFS spectroscopy was used to understand the correlation between the local environment of the Fe atoms and the magnetic anisotropy of the films.", "Hard magnetic SmCo films were prepared by pulsed laser deposition in UHV and at moderate background pressures on polycrystalline Al2O3. Structure and magnetic properties are discussed for varying Sm-content. The perpendicular anisotropy observed at a deposition pressure of 0.06mbar is compared with texturing models known for sputtered samples.", "This work is part of an European research programme (HITEMAG) and we report on the high temperature magnetic properties of Sm(CobalFevCuyZrx)z sintered magnets. The effects of copper and zirconium in dependence on the z-value have been studied. At room temperature, both, a higher Zr and/or higher Cu content, increases the useful z-range with respect to coercivity. An increase in Sm content leads to the best coercivities at high temperatures (450\u2013550\u00b0C: \u03bc0 jHc=0.8\u20130.45T). Higher zirconium content shifts the maximum coercivity to lower samarium levels.", "The nickel iron nitride Ni3Fe-N seems to have the face-centered cubic structure of A4B type. It can be considered that the magnetic structure is decided by the relationship of the electronic orbits N-2p and Ni-3d. The thin films of Ni3Fe-N were prepared by a reactive RF-sputtering method. It was found that the amount of the N2 flow rate greatly affects the crystal growth.", "The magnetization and magnetotransport properties of Ag\u2013Fe granular films have been investigated with hysteresis cycles and DC resistivity measurements under applied magnetic fields up to 1.5T. These samples, grown by RF sputtering, comprised iron clusters embedded in silver matrix, whose grain size dependence on the sputtering power has been extracted from the magnetization curves. The behaviour of the magnetoresistance as a function of the sputtering power, displaying a maximum around 60W, is discussed in the frame of two competing magnetic scattering mechanisms. Besides, the capability of Joule heating to modify the microstructure of these granular samples is shown in the magnetoresistance results. These results confirm the development of enhanced magnetic correlations amongst the enlarged iron clusters.", "We investigated the magneto-elastic properties of 500nm thick sputtered NiFe-31% thin films. The hysteresis curves were measured as function of an externally applied isotropic in-plane stress. Coercivity and hysteresis loss decrease linearly as a function of tensile stress. Reduced pinning of the domain walls is believed to be responsible for the stress dependence.", "Nd2Fe14B \u03a6 phase crystallites were formed in Nd16.7Fe65.5B17.8 thin films prepared by RF sputtering with subsequent heat treatment. The 2\u03bcm-thick films were deposited onto 0.1mm Mo sheets at an average substrate temperature (Ts) of 365\u00b0C. The enhanced magnetic properties of the magnetically anisotropic thin films were investigated using different heating rates (hr) of 10\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, 50\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C/min in an annealing experiment. Transformation from the amorphous phase to the crystalline phase is clearly manifested by the formation of fine crystallites embedded as a columnar matrix of Nd2Fe14B phase. High-resolution scanning electron microscope data of the cross-section of the annealed films show columnar stacking of Nd2Fe14B crystallites with sizes <500nm. Transmission electron microscope observations revealed that the microstructure of these films having out-of-plane magnetization consists of uniformly distributed \u03a6 phase with grain size around 400nm together with small Nd rich particles. This grain size of \u03a6 phase is comparable to the single domain particle diameter of Nd2Fe14B. Significant change in iHc, 4\u03c0Mr\u22a5 and 4\u03c0Ms\u22a5 with hr was confirmed. Annealing conditions with a heating rate of 50\u00b0C/min to an annealing temperature (Ta) of 650\u00b0C for 30min was consequently found to give optimum properties for the NdFeB thin films. The resulting magnetic properties, considered to be the effect of varying hr were iHc= 1307\u20131357kA/m, 4\u03c0Mr\u22a5=0.78\u20131.06T and 4\u03c0Ms\u22a5=0.81\u20131.07T.", "Using a novel combinatorial sputtering system, we have prepared a wide range of Ni/Pt artificial superlattice structures on a single 76mm\u00d776mm wafer. Structures with m (111)-oriented Ni atomic layers followed by n (111)-oriented Pt atomic layers in the repeating unit were made, where 0<m<8 and 0<n<8. The number of Ni and Pt layers, m and n, varied continuously and orthogonally across the wafer, so that all possible combinations of m and n between 0 and 8 were obtained on a single wafer. The films were characterized point by point by X-ray diffraction and electron microprobe analysis. The superlattice structure was extracted using SUPREX software of Fullerton et al. We find well-developed superstructures with little interdiffusion of Ni and Pt for m>2 and n>2 in agreement with previous work. We believe that combinatorial artificial layered structures such as this will be useful in elucidating the magnetic properties of A/B superstructures, where the properties vary strongly with the number of atomic layers of A and B in the repeating unit.", "We have investigated the behavior of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) with antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic coupled NiO/Co hard electrode and single Co soft electrode separated by an aluminum oxide barrier and deposited on float glass substrates. We determined conditions for obtaining strong uniaxial anisotropy in the Co layers induced by the deposition mode of NiO (facing target magnetron). Using a fixed position of the sample, we obtained columnar NiO films inducing a well-defined anisotropy to the subsequently deposited Co layer and square hysteresis loops. This process is compared with the deposition under constant magnetic field (1kOe) and is found to be dominant for controlling the anisotropy. MTJ made with such a process for the bottom electrode show sharp magnetoresistive responses with more than 20% TMR at room temperature along the magnetic easy axis. Weakly anisotropic samples, fabricated by rotating the substrate during NiO sputtering, no applied magnetic field and the same stacking structure exhibit lower TMR values and sensitivity.", "We have studied the influence of RF deposition power on magnetization and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in sputtered Co26Cu74 granular films, in order to increase GMR of as-deposited samples. M(H) measurements are fitted with superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic components and the cluster size inferred. Room temperature magnetoresistance as high as 8% (minimum cluster radius \u223c1.9 nm) was achieved with maximum RF power.", "We prepared thin films of La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 on different substrates with DC sputtering. The measured transport and magnetic properties could be explained by a lattice mismatch induced by the substrate. Hall effect measurements showed a holelike charge carrier density n*h = 1.3 per unit cell below TC. The magnetoresistance results from an increase of the mobility of the charge carriers in magnetic field.", "We studied the structure and magnetic properties of co-sputtered Co1\u2212xCx thin films using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a SQUID magnetometer. These properties were found to depend critically on deposition temperature, TS, and composition, x. Generally, phase separation into metallic Co and graphite-like carbon phases proceeds with increasing TS and decreasing x. Plan view and cross-sectional TEM images of the films prepared showed that Co grains about 10\u201320nm in diameter and 30\u201350nm in height are three-dimensionally separated by graphite-like carbon layers 1\u20132nm thick. Optimum magnetic properties with saturation magnetization of 380emu/cc and coercivity of 400Oe were obtained for a film with x=0.5 and TS=350\u00b0C.", "The magnetization and anisotropy of Ni/V multilayers prepared by RF sputtering are presented. The magnetization decreases with Ni layer thickness tNi and the analysis of the results at 5K indicates the presence of dead Ni layer about 10\u00c5 thick. The Curie temperature TC decreases as a function of film thickness in the same way as is usually found from finite-size effects in other ferromagnets. The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra are obtained with the applied magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the film plane at 300K. From FMR, a negative value for Ni/V interface anisotropy is obtained.", "Magnetic properties such as Curie temperature, saturation magnetisation, hysteresis loop and permeability loss factor of various compositions of NiZn ferrites prepared by the non-conventional citrate precursor method are reported. The optimum properties are obtained for samples sintered at 1200\u00b0C. The significant advantages of this method of preparation are: (i)the low relative loss factor, tan\u03b4/\u03bci, of the order of 10\u22124\u201310\u22125 in the frequency range 100kHz to 8MHz, depending upon the composition, (ii)reduction in the sintering temperature by atleast 100\u00b0C and (iii)reduction in the sintering time from more than 3h for the conventional method to 1h in the present method.", "RF-sputtered CoFe-NM granular alloys (NM=Ag, Cu) with CoFe volume content, xv, ranging from 0.10 to 0.45 have been studied. These two series of samples show similar features depending on the synthesis conditions and post-deposition annealing treatments, revealing the strong dependence of magnetotransport properties on microstructure. Three different regimes have been observed as xv is increased: the classical giant magnetoresistance (GMR) regime at low ferromagnetic contents; at intermediate xv, a domain structure appears, and GMR and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) together with domain wall scattering are observed; and a third regime at xv close but below the volume percolation threshold, where the two latter contributions still coexist, while the GMR contribution has been suppressed by strong magnetic correlations. The role of the metallic matrix is crucial to determine the crossover ferromagnetic contents between these three regimes, which depend on the relative immiscibility of CoFe either in the Ag or Cu matrices and the diffusivity of Ag and Cu. Moreover, the metallic matrix settles the degree of CoFe segregation, sample crystallisation and texture, which are responsible for the magnetotransport properties.", "We present the findings of a new study on the effects of sintering time on the structure and electrochemical properties of layered Li(Ni0.8Co0.2)O2. For this study, we have examined samples prepared with sintering times of 3, 24, 48 and 96 h. The structure was initially examined by powder X-ray diffraction and then more precisely by time of flight powder neutron diffraction, with structural analysis by the Rietveld method being performed. The structural analysis indicated differences in the Li 3a and Ni/Co 3b site occupancies, which appear to be related to the sintering times.Electrochemical charge/discharge measurements indicated that the initial discharge capacities for the samples prepared at 3, 24, and 48 h were basically invariant. However, a sizeable increase was noted for the sample prepared with a sintering time of 96 h. Also, an increase in the obtained discharge capacity from the first to second cycles was found for the samples prepared with 3\u201348 h sintering times. The largest increase was noted for the sample prepared for 48 h. No increase was seen for the sample sintered for 96 h. However, for all samples examined in this work, the capacities on first discharge were in excess of 180 mA h/g.", "We introduced a post-annealing process for the preparation of spinel-phase LiMn2O4. The annealed films had proper crystallinity and surface roughness. In order to reduce the interface reaction during operation, we introduced a diamond-like carbon (DLC) film. The DLC films were deposited on LiMn2O4 films by using electron cyclotron resonance chemical vapor deposition (ECRCVD). A DLC-coated LiMn2O4 film was more stable during the charging\u2013discharging reaction and showed higher discharge capacity over a wide voltage window than the uncoated LiMn2O4 film.", "Spinel ferrites having the general formula CoAlxFe2\u2212xO4 (x=0.0\u20131.0) were prepared using the wet-chemical method. The samples were sintered at 200\u00b0C, 500\u00b0C and 800\u00b0C temperature and were studied by means of X-ray diffraction, magnetization and low-field AC susceptibility measurements. The observed features for the wet samples, such as the intense peak in \u03c7AC\u2013T curve, the co-existence of paramagnetic doublet and magnetic sextets in M\u00f6ssbauer spectra and lower saturation magnetization values confirm fine particle ferrite behaviour. The variation of saturation magnetization with Al3+ substitution is explained on the basis of the N\u00e9el's collinear spin model. The cation distribution is estimated from the X-ray intensity calculations and magnetization measurements.", "Recent developments in sputtering techniques allow the production of polarising supermirrors with a significant in-plane magnetic anisotropy that leads to a pronounced remanent and coercive field along the easy axis of magnetisation. The magnetic layers can be magnetised by a field pulse of B p\u224320 mT either parallel or anti-parallel to a guide field B g\u22431 mT. We show that polarising benders using remanent supermirrors are a versatile means to perform polarisation analysis with a three-axis spectrometer. The major advantages of remanent benders are: (i) no need for spin flippers, (ii) no cross-talk between neutron polarisation and magnetic fields at the sample position, and (iii) ideal for white beam applications.", "The coercive field of modern supermagnets obeys an universal relation H c=(2K 1/\u03bc 0 M s)\u03b1\u2212N eff M s (K 1=first anisotropy constant, M s=spontaneous magnetization). For an interpretation of the microstructural parameters \u03b1 and N eff as determined for sintered and nanocrystalline permanent magnets the finite element method (FEM) has been applied to treat cooperative magnetization processes in assemblies of grains. In order to treat grain boundaries (gbs) more rigorously a numerical method, combining the FEM with the Heisenberg model, has been developed.", "The magnetic properties of Fe\u2013SiO2 nanogranular composite thin films were studied as a function of film thickness and Fe concentration, f, using ferromagnetic resonance at X-band (9.4GHz) and Q-band (35GHz). Films with an Fe volume percent ranging from 17% to 70% were fabricated from a mosaic target using RF sputtering techniques. Film thickness was varied between 10 and 200nm. From measurements made at room temperature with the external field applied parallel and perpendicular to the film plane, it was possible to determine an almost linear dependence of the effective anisotropy field with Fe concentration. Small differences observed between X- and Q-band, specially at low f, were attributed to the effects that the different fields applied during the experiment cause on the magnetic state of the sample. No systematic change of the effective field or the g value was observed in films of different thickness. The absorption line width, on the other hand, was found to depend on film thickness indicating a larger distribution of particle shape and size with increasing film thickness. A maximum in the line width was observed around f\u223c30\u201335% and is probably caused by the transition from single domain ferromagnetic clusters to superparamagnetic particles.", "Granular Fe(110) thin films have been grown on c-sapphire substrates by triode sputtering. Islands size range from 11nm in-plane diameter and 2nm height up to 100nm in-plane and 23nm height, depending on the deposition time. Strong changes in the spin-dependent scattering are found in samples with in-plane diameter below 30nm. This behavior is due to a low-temperature spin freezing of the island boundary magnetic regions, producing a suppression of the exchange coupling between islands. A consequence of the magnetic decoupling is the random arrangement of the individual magnetization, determined by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of each island, that results in a spin-dependent induced increase of the resistivity below the freezing temperature. By applying a high enough magnetic field, magnetic ordering recovers regardless of the temperature, obtaining a typical metallic behavior for the thermal dependence of the resistivity. The ratio of the low-temperature resistivities with and without magnetic field yields magnetoresistance values up to 5.5% for 16.5nm in-plane island sizes. The following two conclusions are obtained: (i) nanocrystalline Fe can be considered as a low-temperature GMR-like system and (ii) Fe grain boundaries are not ferromagnetic at low temperature but behave as a reentrant spin-glass system.", "Ordered arrays of submicrometric Ni lines have been fabricated in sputtered Nb films. Magnetotransport R(H) and (I,V) curves were measured close to the critical temperature using a cross-shape bridge that allows us to apply current in two directions: parallel or perpendicular to the lines. The experimental results show anisotropic vortex motion with clear channeling effects. In R(H) data, magnetic features appear but they are absent in the (I,V) curves.", "The influence of composition deviations from the Y123 stoichiometry on Tc, diamagnetic response and the texture of films prepared by MOCVD was studied and corresponding topograms were plotted. The role of proximity of the deposition temperature to the temperature of melt appearance is discussed.", "The effects of the thallium and mercury content x on the as-sintered and post annealed samples of MxPb0.4Sr1.6Ba0.4Ca2Cu3O8+\u03b4 {M: Tl (0.32\u2264x\u22640.74) or Hg (0.18\u2264x\u22640.68)} have been studied by magnetization and transport measurements. For Tl-1223 we have found the optimum Tl doping level to be x=0.53 regarding the grain properties, the content of superconducting phase, the first penetration field Hplwl, the transport (Jctr), magnetic intergrain (JcM) and intragrain (Jcg) critical current densities. The critical temperature Tc of the as-sintered Tl-1223 sample decreased with increasing Tl content. Post-annealing in oxygen improved the Tc for Tl contents of x\u22650.53 and had generally positive effects on the critical current densities. The intergrain properties of the Hg-1223 samples were much worse than those of the Tl-based superconductors.", "Relationship between the crystallographic orientation and the electrical properties of the Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, (PZT) thin films prepared by rf magnetron sputtering was investigated. The PZT films were deposited at 150, 250 or 340\u00b0C and, followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA). It was found that the crystallographic orientation of the PZT films could be controlled only by the deposition temperature and the ferroelectric properties were dependent upon the orientation of the films. It was suggested that the difference in the atomic mobility at the substrate surface during deposition was closely related to the film orientation. The films with (111) orientation showed relatively high capacitance and the remanant polarization values.", "Zinc oxide coatings have been deposited on polyethylene terephthalate by r.f. magnetron sputtering from a ceramic target in different argon\u2013oxygen mixtures. The influence of the sputtering parameters on the properties of the coatings was studied. It was found that ZnO deposits crystallize in the w\u00fcrtzite phase and that the crystallinity decreased when the oxygen partial pressure increased. The composition and the optical constants (refractive index, extinction coefficient, optical band gap) of the ZnO films were varied over a wide range depending on sputtering parameters. In addition, the ZnO films grow under a state of compression, which is mainly due to the internal defects. The stress increased with the sputtered particles energy. The better adhesion between the coating and the polymer induced by cold plasma treatments and the influence of the sputtering conditions were also studied. The permeability to oxygen was limited and the PET photo-oxidation rate was strongly reduced once the polymer had been coated with ZnO layers prepared under optimal conditions.", "Characterization of self-assembled lateral superlattices in AlInAs epitaxial layers and AlAs/InAs short-period superlattices is presented. These structures are spontaneously generated during the epitaxial growth by metal\u2013organic chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the structural details and electro-modulated reflectance is used to characterize the energy and anisotropy of the optical transitions in the lateral superlattices. We demonstrate several properties of these self-assembled structures: (a) the band gap energy can be changed by as much as 350 meV, (b) the polarization anisotropy of the lowest energy transition exceeds 90%, (c) the superlattice axis and the direction of the optical anisotropy can be oriented along two non-equivalent directions in the plane of the substrate, and (d) the valence band splitting between heavy- and light-hole transitions is significant. We discuss the difference between the samples from the two growth techniques. Finally, we theoretically model the electronic states in these lateral superlattices and we demonstrate that the difference in average InAs composition between the well and barrier can be as high as 35%.", "Piezoelectric and ferroelectric films are very promising materials for microelectronic applications. In this paper, some important issues for these materials and applications are reviewed, and recent progresses on integrated ferroelectrics have been given. The physical and chemical preparation methods of the silicon-based piezoelectric and ferroelectric films, such as Sol\u2013Gel, sputtering, metal organic chemical vapor deposition, have been described and compared. To realize a microelectronic device, the integrated circuits compatible ferroelectric/piezoelectric etching method is very important. The wet-chemical etching methods and dry-etching methods, such as reactive ion etching, have been introduced. There are many important applications for the silicon-based piezoelectric and ferroelectric films. One is the micro-sensors or micro-actuators or micro-electro-mechanical-system. Another is the memory devices. Some typical devices using piezoelectric and ferroelectric films have been introduced.", "This paper reports the deposition of hydrogenated silicon carbide (SiC:H) films using the electron cyclotron resonance chemical vapour deposition (ECR-CVD) technique. Using this technique, SiC:H films were prepared from a mixture of methane, silane and hydrogen, with phosphine as the doping gas. The effects of changing the phosphine fraction on the optical bandgap, activation energy and conductivity were investigated in films deposited at two different microwave powers of 150 and 600 W, respectively. The results showed that the deposition conditions strongly influence the structural, optical and electrical properties of the SiC:H films. In films deposited at low and high microwave powers, phosphorus doping has the effect of enhancing the formation of the silicon microcrystalline phase. In films which contain a strong silicon microcrystalline phase, the optical bandgap remained relatively constant while the conductivity increased rapidly followed by saturation. Correspondingly, the activation energy decreased and saturated suggesting an effect due to dopant saturation. The results showed that good phosphorus doping efficiency can be obtained in SiC:H films deposited at high microwave power.", "Optimization of deposition conditions for nitrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:N) films prepared by a dual ion beam sputtering (DIBS) technique is reported. A ripple structure was observed on the surface of a-C:N films, which was believed to be corresponding to the off-normal incidence bombardment by N ions during deposition. Infrared spectra indicated that the nitrogen atoms incorporated were bonded as C\u2013N, C\ue605N and C\ue606N in the carbon network. The relative intensity of D and G bands obtained by fitting the Raman spectra showed that the sp3 content in the a-C:N films increased as the Ar ion energy was increased and the sp3 content was the highest with 100 eV N ion bombardment. The maximum micro-hardness achieved was about 25 GPa for the 200 nm thick a-C:N films deposited under the optimized conditions. The compressive stress ranged from 1 to 3 GPa. The optical band gap determined by spectral ellipsometry ranged from 0.6 to 1.0 eV. The refractive index and extinction coefficient at 633 nm wavelength were about 2.14 and 0.22 for the films deposited under the optimized conditions, respectively. Hardness, stress and optical band gap measurements showed a similar trend with the relative intensity of ID/IG.", "High quality orientated YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x (x=0.1\u20130.2) (YBCO) superconducting coatings were produced by the electrophoretic deposition technique. The fine particle YBCO powder used, was produced by the oxalate co-precipitation method on Au/Si and Pt/Si wafers. The optimized thermal treatment for both, powders and coatings, was followed by thermal analysis (thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)). The powders and coatings obtained, were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy, magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements. It resulted that by the oxalate co-precipitation method finer and more homogeneous nanocrystalline YBCO powders were produced in comparison to the solid state reaction method, leading to more favorable conditions for their thermal treatment, like lower sintering temperature and shorter duration of the sintering process, as well as better superconducting properties, expressed by the shape and value of the corresponding magnetization curves. Furthermore, the production of the coatings was achieved in a shorter electrophoresis time by the powders from the co-precipitation method and the coatings produced were orientated having improved superconducting properties in comparison to those obtained by the solid state reaction method.", "Anisotropic NdFeB magnets find application in electric motors where high flux densities combined with high coercivities are required. Such magnets can be produced by hot deformation of nanocrystalline NdFeB alloys. In particular, the backward extrusion process results in radially oriented ring magnets. The hot working process can be carried out in such a way that the ring magnets obtained after cutting off the top and the bottom are suited for direct use on the rotor in an electric motor. This is possible for a wide range of dimensions, which means that the ring magnets can be produced in a near net shape. Especially, smaller wall depths of the rings are realizable compared with sintered magnets. Major benefits are the simpler rotor construction, a greatly reduced rotor assembly time and simpler magnet retention on the rotor due to greater mechanical integrity of the magnetic structure. After a brief explanation of the backward extrusion process, the used dies and the corresponding rings are presented. Finally, the homogeneity of the magnetic properties and of the deformation process are discussed.", "The goal of this study was to fabricate intricate parts possessing good soft magnetic properties, using iron\u2013nickel\u2013phosphorous ternary alloy powders prepared by simultaneous electroless-plating of nickel and phosphorous onto the surface of iron powder. The concentration of phosphorous is slightly higher than its maximum solubility in the solid solution of iron and nickel. When mixed with an appropriate amount of binder, the powder can be formed into intricate parts by standard injection molding procedures. Low sintering temperatures afford parts with high sintered density, isotropic sintered shrinkage, and a composite structure characterized by large spheroidal grains of solid solution of iron, nickel, and phosphorous imbedded in insulating iron\u2013nickel phosphide. Compared with alloys of similar compositions where the powders were prepared by blending powders of Fe and Fe3P, the sintered microstructure thus processed was significantly improved, as residual porosity could hardly be found. Nevertheless, the magnetic properties of the sintered alloy tested in a direct magnetic field were not enhanced substantially, due to the high residual carbon content of the alloy.", "Anisotropic SmCo7\u2212xCux (x=0\u20134.5) ribbons have been prepared by melt spinning at a low wheel speed of 5 m/s. Scanning electron microscopy results show that Cu-free and Cu-containing ribbons consist of equiaxed and columnar dendrite grains, respectively. The arrangement of columnar dendrite grains of the ribbons was found to be more ordered with increasing Cu content x. Together with the results of magnetic measurement, it is derived that Cu substitution is helpful to enhance the degree of preferred orientation of the c-axis of the columnar dendrite grains parallel to the longitudinal direction of the ribbons. In this way the rectangularity of demagnetization curves and the remanence ratio (defined as the ratio of remanent magnetization to saturation magnetization) of the samples are significantly improved. A remanence ratio of 0.90, which is close to that of sintered SmCo magnets, has been achieved in the ribbons with x=2.5. Because the domain-wall-energy gradient between the 1:5 and 2:17 phases, which determines the value of the coercive force arising from the domain wall pinning, may increase with x, the coercivity of the samples with x\u22643.5 increases strongly with x. Without heat treatment, a coercive force (iHc) of up to 9.2 kOe is obtained in the ribbons with x=3.5.", "NdFeB and PrFeB nanocomposite hard magnetic materials of the exchange-spring type were prepared by splat-cooling. Hysteresis cycles reveal that magnetisation processes may be analysed in terms of two contributions arising from the two different phases which exist in these systems. The soft phase magnetisation reverses first at a field of approximately 0.3 T which is found to be little temperature dependent. Reversal is determined by exchange coupling with the hard phase. A grain size of 20 nm is deduced. This value is in agreement with structural analysis. The hard-phase magnetisation reverses at a larger field value which is found to increase steadily with decreasing temperature (2.75 T in the PrFeB samples and 1.1 T in the NdFeB sample at 20 K). Reversal is found to be determined by processes which are reminiscent of those characterising reversal in usual sintered or melt-spun RFeB magnets. At room temperature, the activation volume deduced from magnetic after-effect measurements is 2200 nm3. The contribution of inter-particle dipole interactions to magnetisation reversal is found to be small.", "The effects of sample preparation of a Mg2Ni anode for a nickel/metal hydride battery were studied with an open electrochemical cell. The discharge capacity of sintered Mg2Ni increased initially with the charge/discharge cycles. The cycle life (CL) for sintered samples was much greater than that of un-sintered samples, and the largest CL appeared at a sintering temperature of 550\u00b0C. It was also observed that slight pre-oxidation of the sample powder was effective in improving the CL. Those effects were examined through the changes in the specific surface area and the chemical composition. The sample sintered at 550\u00b0C had the largest specific surface area, and the segregation of Mg over the outside layer of samples was confirmed for those sintered at temperatures higher than 550\u00b0C. The degradation after charge/discharge cycling was investigated with X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The XRD pattern showed a new phase of Mg(OH)2, besides the phase of Mg2Ni, after charge/discharge cycling. This indicates that the formation of Mg(OH)2 on the outside layer of the samples contributes to the degradation of the anode performance.", "A complementary study of composition and bonding of sputtered a-C films, deposited on Si(001) substrates with various bias voltages (Vb) applied to the substrate during deposition is presented. The sp3 and sp2 fractions in the films were calculated by deconvolution of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) C1s peak and studied by the differential auger electron spectroscopy (AES) CKLL peak signal. The results of this analysis are compared with the estimation of sp3 fraction calculated by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and validated using density measurements by X-ray reflectivity. It was observed a considerable increase of sp3 content in films deposited with negative Vb. The respective sp3 and sp2 fractions and Ar concentration with respect to the Vb and the depth profile analysis give valuable information on the deposition mechanism of the sputtered a-C films. XPS valence band spectra provided the electron density of states in the a-C films\u2019 valence band. The characteristic broad p band of diamond was prominent in most of the films. The valence band structure of the films was correlated with their optical response measured by SE.", "Single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes are very interesting nanoscaled materials with many possible applications in nanoelectronics. Especially, nanotubes filled with ferromagnetic materials (Fe, Co, Ni) may have significant potential in data storage. Such structures may help to exceed the best available storage densities (>65 Gb/inch2) and show in the case of Fe-filled nanotubes higher coercivities compared to bulk Fe. In addition, metal-filled carbon nanotubes are promising nanowires with excellent oxidation protection. In this paper we describe the synthesis of Fe-, Ni- and Co-filled carbon nanotubes by using the chemical vapor deposition method. Varying the deposition conditions we have obtained filled nanotubes with relatively uniform core diameters and different thicknesses of the carbon walls. The core diameters vary between 15 and 30 nm and the thickness of the carbon shells between 2 and 60 nm. The length of the tubes amounts up to 30 \u03bcm. The filled carbon nanotubes are characterised by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The magnetic behaviour of the aligned Fe-filled tubes is investigated using alternating gradient magnetometry measurements and electron holography. The hysteresis loops indicate a magnetic anisotropy. The coercivity depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field. The observed enhanced coercivities are significantly higher than in bulk Fe.", "There has been a growing interest in hydrogenated silicon carbide films (SiC:H) prepared using the electron cyclotron resonance-chemical vapour deposition (ECR-CVD) technique. Using the ECR-CVD technique, SiC:H films have been prepared from a mixture of methane, silane and hydrogen, with phosphine as the doping gas. The effects of changes in the microwave power (from 150 to 900 W) on the film properties were investigated in a series of phosphorus-doped SiC:H films. In particular, the changes in the deposition rate, optical bandgap, activation energy and conductivity were investigated in conjunction with results from Raman scattering and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis. It was found that increase in the microwave power has the effect of enhancing the formation of the silicon microcrystalline phase in the amorphous matrix of the SiC:H films. This occurs in correspondence to a rapid increase in the conductivity and a reduction in the activation energy, both of which exhibit small variations in samples deposited at microwave powers exceeding 500 W. Analysis of IR absorption results suggests that hydrogen is bonded to silicon in the Si\ue5f8H stretching mode and to carbon in the sp3 CHn rocking/wagging and bending mode in films deposited at higher microwave powers.", "In this work we used the quasi-steady-state photocurrent method and photothermal ionisation spectroscopy (PTIS) to study the electronic structure of the P-related level in n-type phosphorus doped CVD diamond. Previously, we reported the existence of two optically active defect levels, labelled XP1 and XP2, in the bandgap of these P-doped layers. XP2 appeared to be only present in films showing high resistivity. Here we present a detailed PTIS and photocurrent study of the photoionisation cross-section, from liquid helium up to room temperature. At low temperatures, samples containing only the XP1 defect show a phonon-induced oscillatory photoconductivity, giving information about the electronic structure of this defect. Additionally, with PTIS a sharp maximum was detected around 565meV, originating from a thermal promotion of charge carriers from an excited state of the phosphorus-related level into the conduction band. We also discuss different models for the optical ionisation cross-section of the P-related level (e.g. shallow level, deep level).", "a-SiOx films have been prepared using silane and pure oxygen as reactive gases in plasma CVD system. Diborane was introduced as a doping gas to obtain p-type conduction silicon oxide. Infrared absorption spectra show the incorporation of Si\u2013O stretch mode around 1000cm\u22121. The optical bandgap increases with the oxygen to silane gas ratio, while the electrical conductivity decreases. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cells have been fabricated using p-type a-SiOx with around 1.85eV optical bandgap and conductivity greater than 10\u22127S/cm. The measured current\u2013voltage characteristics of the solar cells under 100mW/cm2 artificial light are Voc=0.84V, Jsc=14.7mA/cm2, FF=0.635 with a conversion efficiency of 7.84%.", "Sintered Bi2O3 pellets exhibited insulating properties at room temperature. Partial reduction of sintered Bi2O3 pellets increased the conductivity. Reduced Bi2O3 pellets exhibited n-type semiconductor properties. Microcrystals of Bi2S3 were formed on sintered Bi2O3 pellets by sulfurizing them in H2S atmosphere. The direct band-gap and indirect band-gap of Bi2S3 were evaluated as 1.2 and 0.4eV, respectively. A high incident photon to current conversion efficiency in the near IR region was observed on Bi2S3|Bi2O3 electrodes. Photocurrent generation of Bi2S3|Bi2O3 electrodes was explained from the viewpoint of semiconductor sensitization. The flat band potential of Bi2S3 was evaluated as \u22121.1V vs. Ag|AgCl in aqueous polysulfide redox electrolyte (1M OH\u2212, 1M S2\u2212, 10\u22122M S).", "We have grown silicon nitride (SiN:H) thin films on silicon and glass by the Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) Method at low temperature in order to study their electro-optical properties and correlate these properties to the chemical composition of the layers, so that optimum films may be achieved for silicon solar cells. By varying the silane to ammonia ratio in the plasma gas we have been able to modify the index of refraction, the optical band gap and the silicon surface state passivation properties of the films. From this information we have determined that the optimum silane to ammonia ratio, with other constant parameters in our system, should be 20/65. Our results indicate that the mid-gap surface state density in silicon can be reduced down to 1010cm\u22122eV\u22121 when this optimum (silane to ammonia) ratio is used for depositing SiN:H layers. We have confirmed this optimal ratio by making quantum efficiency measurements on silicon solar cells having their emitter passivated with SiN:H layers deposited with different silane to ammonia ratios. A great reduction of the surface recombination velocity was achieved, as observed from the internal quantum efficiency measurements, for cells with optimal SiN:H layers as compared to those with non-optimum SiN:H layers.", "Nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) films deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition exhibited room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) with two peaks at around 1.8 eV (700 nm) and 2.2\u20132.3 eV (540\u2013560 nm). The first 1.8-eV peak is related to a quantum size effect and another peak to the SiH-related bonds. The average grain size, \u3008\u03b4\u3009, and crystalline volume fraction, \u03c1, decrease with decreasing gas pressure. By contrast, all of the PL peak energy, PL intensity and optical band gap increase. In addition, by increasing the H2 flow rate, rf power and deposition temperature, it is found that the values of \u3008\u03b4\u3009, \u03c1 and PL intensity increase and PL peak energy decreases.", "We are interested in studying thin layers of CoPt alloy prepared by co-deposition sputtering. The CoPt layers are deposited on a MgO(001) substrate with a Pt(001) buffer layer. We obtain a layer with the L10 tetragonal structure, ordered in the growth direction. This equiatomic L10 phase is a \u201cnatural\u201d multilayer which consists in a stacking along the (001) direction of pure Co and pure Pt monolayers. In this case, we get an easy magnetization direction perpendicular to the layer plane, which is the required configuration for the perpendicular magneto-optic recording. The order state of these thin films has been modified locally by a low energy ion irradiation. The structural and magnetic properties have changed jointly: with a 40-keV energy and a 4\u00d71016-ions/cm2 flux, the chemical order decreases (the long-range-order (LRO) parameter changed from S=0.80 to S=0.50), the coercive field diminished from 0.090 T down to 0.052 T. Such results show that it is possible to locally change the magnetization easy axis, which is promising for applications.", "A series of nitrate\u2013citrate gels were prepared from metal nitrates and citric acid via a sol-gel process, in order to synthesize titanium-substituted lithium zinc (LiZn) ferrites with composition of Li0.5(0.4+x)Zn0.6TixFe(2.2\u22121.5x)O4 (x ranging from 0.05 to 0.20). The thermal decomposition process was investigated by DTA-TGA, IR and XRD techniques. The dried gels can burn in a self-propagating combustion process in air to transform into single-phase, nano-crystalline ferrite particles. The low-temperature sintering was realized using the synthesized powders, and the sintered ferrites have fine-grained microstructures and excellent magnetic properties. Appropriate amounts of titanium substituted for Fe in LiZn ferrites can significantly increase the permeability value. The prepared LiZn ferrites are good materials for multilayer chip inductors.", "Aluminum doped zinc oxide polycrystalline thin films (AZO) were prepared by sol-gel dip-coating process. The sol was prepared from an ethanolic solution of zinc acetate using lithium hydroxide or succinic acid as hydrolytic catalyst. The quantity of aluminum in the sol was varied from 1 to 10 mol%. The structural characteristics studied by X-ray diffractometry were complemented by resistivity measurements and UV\u2013Vis-NIR spectroscopy. The films are transparent from the near ultraviolet to the near infrared, presenting an absorption cut-off at almost 290 nm, irrespective of the nature of the catalyst and doping level. The best conductors were obtained for the AZO films containing 3 mol% of aluminum, prepared under acidic and basic catalysis and sintered at 450 \u00b0C. Their optical band-gap of 4.4 eV calculated from the absorption cut-off is larger than the values for band-gap widening predicted by the standard model for polar semiconductors. These polycrystalline films are textured with preferential orientation of grains along the wurtzite c-axis or the (100) direction.", "An investigation has been carried out into the acceptor-doping of lead magnesium niobate titanate (PMNT), 0.95{Pb(Mg 1 3 Nb 2 3 )O3-0.05 PbTiO3}, through the introduction of cobalt ions. These are added by co-reaction of PMNT powder with CoO and PbO in a single-stage reaction to sintered ceramics. The technique is found to enhance the sinter-ability of PMNT in less oxidising CO2 atmospheres. Furthermore, the dielectric response of the Co-doped ceramics depends on the sintering atmosphere employed. In air, a transition from relaxor to normal ferroelectric properties takes place upon addition of cobalt. However, in CO2, relaxor properties persist at all levels of cobalt-substitution. This difference in behaviour is attributed to varying oxidation states of the cobalt ions, it being proposed that that air-sintered samples consist of a mixture of Co2+ and Co3+ ions. In CO2-sintered samples, by comparison, the cobalt ions exist only in the + 2 oxidation state. The relevance to the formation of dipoles, and to an understanding of relaxor ferroelectric ceramics is brought out, comparing the observed behaviour with that of PMNT doped with manganese.", "We designed an automated workstation for magnetic particle-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discrimination of ALDH genotypes. Bacterial magnetic particles (BMPs) extracted from Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 were used as DNA carriers. The principle for SNP discrimination in this study was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between FITC (donor) and POPO-3 (acceptor) bound to double-stranded DNA. The workstation is equipped with a 96-way automated pipetter which collects and dispenses fluids as it moves in x- and z-directions. The platform contains a disposable tip rack station, a reagent vessel serving as a stock for POPO-3 and FITC-labeled probes and a reaction station for a 96-well microtiter plate. BMPs were collected by attaching a neodymium iron boron sintered (Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B) magnet on the bottom of the microtiter plate. This system permits the simultaneous heating and magnetic separation of 96 samples per assay. The genotypes ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 were discriminated by calculating the relative fluorescence intensities on BMPs.", "Zn0.95Co0.05O and Zn0.91Co0.05Cu0.04O thin films were fabricated on Si (111) substrate by the reactive magnetron sputtering method at different O-Ar ratios. Detailed characterizations by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), X-ray photo-electronic spectrum (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) indicate that the doped Cu ions substitute the Zn2+ ions in the ZnO lattice. The doped Cu ions are in Cu+ and Cu2+ mixture valence states. The ferromagnetism of the Zn0.91Co0.05Cu0.04O film increases gradually the increasing Cu+ ions concentration. The results indicate that the increase of ferromagnetism is not owing to the magnetic contribution of Cu+ ions themselves, but owing to the enhancement of magnetic interaction between Co ions, which suggests that p-type doping of Cu+ ions plays an important role in mediating the ferromagnetic coupling between Co ions.", "Li3V2(PO4)3 cathode material was prepared by a carbon-thermal reduction (CTR) process. V2O5, LiOH\u00b7H2O, NH4H2PO4 and C were used as starting materials to synthesize Li3V2(PO4)3 by sintering the mixture at 800 \u00b0C for 24 h. The property of the Li3V2(PO4)3 sample was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical measurement. The results show that the Li3V2(PO4)3 sample has the same monoclinic structure as the Li3V2(PO4)3 sample synthesized by hydrogen reduction method. The particle size is about 1.5 \u03bcm together with homogenous distribution. The initial discharge capacity of Li3V2(PO4)3 powder is 120 mA\u00b7h\u00b7g\u22121 at the rate of 0.1 C, and the capacity retains 112 mA\u00b7h\u00b7g\u22121 after 30 cycles.", "Exchange coupling and magnetic properties of SmCo5 alloys containing different amounts of Sn were investigated in sintered magnets. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of Sm2Co17 and Sm2Co7 phases in SmCo5 matrix. Exchange coupling mechanism was evaluated by switching field distribution, dc- demagnetization and magnetization curves as function of reverse applied field. Energy product of 59.2 kJ/m3 (7.4 MGOe), remanent magnetization to maximum magnetization ratio of 0.97 and remanence coercivity to intrinsic coercivity ratio of 1.75 were achieved for 0.2 at.% Sn.", "The manganite La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) thin films were grown on glass substrates in a mixed argon and oxygen atmosphere by using RF magnetron sputtering. The structural characteristics, transport behaviors and magnetic properties of LSMO films were studied by annealing the films in air at 550 and 620\u00b0C. The out-of-plane lattice parameter aLSMO contracted after annealing and was close to that of bulk LSMO abulk, indicating that the internal strain was fully relaxed. Nanocrystalline grains were observed in the annealed films. Enhanced saturation magnetization and metal-to-insulator transition temperature (TMI=268 K) were also obtained. Curie temperatures (Tc) of the as-grown films was 340 K with the same as that of annealed at 550\u00b0C, but dropped to 315 K when the annealing temperature increased to 620\u00b0C, which can be attributed to the oxygen release during annealing in atmosphere.", "Copper nitride (Cu3N) films were prepared by reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering at various nitrogen partial pressures, and the films were annealed at different temperatures. The crystal structure of the films was identified by X-ray diffraction technique. The Cu3N films have a cubic anti-ReO3 structure, and lattice constant is 0.3855 nm. With increasing nitrogen partial pressure, the Cu3N films are strongly textured with the crystal direction [100]. The atomic force microscope images show that the films presence a smooth and compact morphology with nanocrystallites of about 70 nm in size. The films were further characterized by UV-visible spectrometer, and the optical band gap of the films was calculated from the Tauc equation. The typical value of optical band gap of the films is about 1.75 eV, and it increases with increasing nitrogen partial pressure. The thermal property of the films was measured by thermogravimetry, and the decomposition temperature of the films was about 530 K.", "Solid solutions of Dy1\u2212xCaxMnO3 (0.00\u2a7dx\u2a7d0.60) were prepared by solid state reaction of oxides and carbonates. Sintered bodies were obtained by firing between 1250 and 1450\u00b0C. All compositions, including DyMnO3, crystallize in a perovskite structure of O\u2032-type orthorhombic symmetry and space group Pbnm. Increase of Ca2+ content leads to a monotonic decrease of the orthorhombicity factor b/a. Electrical measurements show a semiconducting behavior for all compositions. The room temperature conductivity increases with Ca content, attaining relatively high values at x=0.60 and a correlative very low value of the activation energy. Thermally-activated small-polaron hopping mechanism controls the conductivity. Antiferromagnetic interactions between Dy spins are observed at TN=9.5 K. DyMnO3 behaves as a metamagnetic-like system, with no remanent magnetization at zero field. ZFC/FC cycles and the thermal evolution of the remanent magnetization of the Dy1\u2212xCaxMnO3 solid solution show the presence of two interacting magnetic networks: a Dy sublattice, with a Curie\u2013Weiss thermal dependence above TN, aligned antiparallel to the ferromagnetically ordered (Tc=80 K) Mn network. The local field at a given site depends on the exchange interaction J between these two sublattices, leading to a spin reversal when the magnetic moment of the dysprosium network is larger than the one produced by the ferromagnetic Mn sublattice.", "The temperature dependence of electric parameters of the sintered compound PbZr0.5Ti0.44(Cu1/4Nb3/4)0.06O3+0.5 mol% MnO2 was investigated using a.c. measurements. The temperature dependence of the a.c. conductivity in the vicinity of Tc is highly non-linear with a local maximum in conductivity observed at that temperature. The total conductivity \u03c3t(\u03c9), as a function of frequency, exhibits a power law dependence (\u03c30+A\u03c9s), whose exponent s is maximized at the ferro\u2013paraelectric transition.", "Exchange-spring magnets based on the interfacial coupling of soft and hard ferromagnetic nanocomposites have the potential to outperform existing commercial permanent magnets. We present investigations of the magnetic reversal behavior in epitaxial thin film exchange-spring structures that consist of sputtered hard (Sm\u2013Co) and soft (Fe, Co) magnetic layers. The results illustrate close correlations between the magnetic behavior and the microstructure and spin configuration of the hard layers.", "In recent plant hormone research, there is an increased demand for a highly sensitive and comprehensive analytical approach to elucidate the hormonal signaling networks, functions, and dynamics. We have demonstrated the high sensitivity of a comprehensive and quantitative analytical method developed with nanoflow liquid chromatography\u2013electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry (LC\u2013ESI-IT-MS/MS) under multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) in plant hormone profiling. Unlabeled and deuterium-labeled isotopomers of four classes of plant hormones and their derivatives, auxins, cytokinins (CK), abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellins (GA), were analyzed by this method. The optimized nanoflow-LC\u2013ESI-IT-MS/MS method showed ca. 5\u201310-fold greater sensitivity than capillary-LC\u2013ESI-IT-MS/MS, and the detection limits (S/N=3) of several plant hormones were in the sub-fmol range. The results showed excellent linearity (R 2 values of 0.9937\u20131.0000) and reproducibility of elution times (relative standard deviations, RSDs, 1.1%) and peak areas (RSDs, 10.7%) for all target compounds. Further, sample purification using Oasis HLB and Oasis MCX cartridges significantly decreased the ion-suppressing effects of biological matrix as compared to the purification using only Oasis HLB cartridge. The optimized nanoflow-LC\u2013ESI-IT-MS/MS method was successfully used to analyze endogenous plant hormones in Arabidopsis and tobacco samples. The samples used in this analysis were extracted from only 17 tobacco dry seeds (1mg DW), indicating that the efficiency of analysis of endogenous plant hormones strongly depends on the detection sensitivity of the method. Our analytical approach will be useful for in-depth studies on complex plant hormonal metabolism.", "Functional oxides on Cu have multiple applications. For thick films the required high sintering temperatures present a challenge for processing on base metal substrates. In this study it is shown that it is possible to adapt well-known ceramic processing strategies to the fabrication of thick lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films on Cu with useful ferroelectric properties. PZT powders with optimized particle sizes are used to fabricate thick films by electrophoretic deposition in combination with a post-deposition isostatic pressing step. This approach to maximize green packing is sufficient to dramatically lower the required sintering temperatures. 25\u03bcm thick PZT films on Cu sintered at 900\u00b0C have a dielectric permittivity of 585, a loss tangent at 10kHz of 0.03, a remanent polarization of 19\u03bcCcm\u22122 and a coercive field of 22kVcm\u22121. This significant improvement in the dielectric response opens the possibility of using thick PZT films on Cu for a wide range of devices where cost, yield and reliability are concerns.", "Nd-rich phase plays a critical role in wetting grain boundary and facilitating texture formation for hot deformed (HD) Nd-Fe-B magnets. In this study, a non-uniform distribution of Nd-rich phase with dimension up to a few micrometers was observed in nanocrystalline HD magnets. The aggregation of the Nd-rich phase is confirmed to result from the low density precursor prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The large local demagnetizing fields induced by Nd-rich phase aggregation led to the open recoil loops and reduced coercivity. Upon reducing recoil loop openness by eliminating Nd-rich phase aggregation, the coercivity of the HD magnet was significantly improved from 226 kA/m to 995 kA/m, and a high maximum energy product of 293 kJ/m3 was obtained. The dependences of microstructure and coercivity on the recoil loop characteristics suggest an essential approach for improving the magnetic properties of nanocrystalline HD Nd-Fe-B magnets.", "A novel ferromagnetic state coexisting with ferroelectric ordering at room temperature in strained BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films grown using a sputtering technique on La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SiO2/Si(100) (LSMO/SOS) substrates is reported. The properties of BFO films with different thicknesses (t\n                     BFO\u00a0=\u00a015, 50, 70, 120, and 140\u00a0nm) on 40\u00a0nm LSMO layers are explored. [012] out-of-plane highly textured BFO/LSMO stacks grew with rhombohedral structures. LSMO layers are nanostructured in nature, constituted by ferromagnetic single-domain nanoregions induced by the constrain of the SiO2 surface, with T\n                     C \u223c200\u00a0K and high coercive field (H\n                     C) of \u223c1100\u00a0Oe\u00a0at 2.5\u00a0K. BFO films grew epitaxially nanostructured on LSMO, exhibiting \u223c4\u00a0nm spherical nanoregions. The BFO layers show typical antiferromagnetic behavior (in a greater volume fraction) when made thicker (t\n                     BFO\u00a0>\u00a070\u00a0nm). The thinner films (t\n                     BFO\u00a0<\u00a050\u00a0nm) display ferromagnetic behavior with T\n                     C\u00a0>\u00a0400\u00a0K, H\n                     C\u00a0\u223c\u00a01600\u00a0Oe for 15\u00a0nm and \u223c1830\u00a0Oe for 50\u00a0nm. We propose that such ferromagnetic behavior is originated by the establishment of a new magnetic configuration in the Fe3+\n                     OFe3+ sublattice of the BFO structure, induced by strong hybridization at the interface as consequence of superexchange coupling interactions with the ferromagnetic Mn3+\n                     OMn3+/Mn4+ sublattice of LSMO. All BFO layers show excellent ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties (coercive field\u00a0\u223c\u00a0740\u00a0kV/cm, and d\n                     33\u00a0=\u00a023 p.m./V for 50\u00a0nm; \u223c200\u00a0kV/cm and 55 p.m./V for 140\u00a0nm), exhibiting 180\u00b0 and 109\u00b0 DWs structures depending on the thickness. Such multiferroic properties predict the potential realization of new magneto-electronic devices integrated with Si technology.", "Sputter growth of highly conductive Ga-doped ZnO films with abnormally wide band-gap (Eg) is discussed in detail, as well as the accompanying defect behavior. It was observed that the optical Eg and the conductivity increased as the working pressure of the Ar plasma decreases. The ZnGaO films with Eg of 3.95\u00a0eV and resistivity of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm was obtained by simply lowering the working pressure to 0.3\u00a0Pa, which represent the highest Eg value so far reported for the ZnO-based transparent conducting materials with a resistivity lower than 10\u22123\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm. It was proposed that this phenomenon may be attributed to the improved crystalline quality and the increased amount of the Ga incorporation into the Zn sites and the oxygen vacancy concentration. It was also suggested that the oxygen vacancy acts as the electron donor for the sputtered ZnO and ZnGaO films.", "Conventional ferroelectric oxides are of generally non-centrosymmetric crystals resulting from paraelectric-ferroelectric transitions. Here, we present a new donor-acceptor ion co-doping route to room-temperature ferroelectricity in rutile TiO2, where ionic pair of co-doping ions plays very important roles in generating local broken symmetry and polarization. The (Nb\u00a0+\u00a0Al) co-doped TiO2 sintered with a two-step method exhibits ferroelectricity and piezoelectric response, and it is believed that Nb5+-Al3+ pairs along TiO2 [001] direction play important role in the ferroelectricity. A large lattice distortion can be induced in the vicinity of the ionic pair, which results in local broken-symmetry. The relative displacements of cations and anions around the ionic pair, induced by the lattice distortion, cause the local polarization. The results and mechanisms presented in this work provide a new approach to the design of new ferroelectrics via doping engineering.", "Catalytic purification of air containing 250ppm of toluene assisted by non-thermal plasma was carried out with a novel dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor with an inner electrode made of sintered metal fibers (SMF). The optimization of the reactor performance was carried out by modifying the SMF with Mn and Co oxides, varying the voltage from 12.5 to 22.5kV and the frequency in the range of 200\u2013450Hz. Under the experimental conditions used, the MnO x /SMF showed better activity than CoO x /SMF and SMF during the total oxidation of toluene. The complete oxidation of 250ppm of toluene was possible with the MnO x /SMF catalytic electrode at the specific input energy (SIE) of \u223c1650J/l. A higher SIE of \u223c2100J/l was required with CoO x /SMF for the total oxidation of toluene to CO2. The better performance of the MnO x /SMF compared to other catalytic electrodes seems to be related to the formation of short-lived species by the in situ decomposition of ozone. XPS analysis of the solid deposit formed on the electrode surface shows the formation of carbonaceous species containing oxygen and nitrogen groups.", "We investigated the synergetic effect of electrochemical and photocatalytic oxidation in photoelectrochemical (PEC) process for the degradation of hazardous organic compounds exemplified by methyl orange, an azo dye. Nitrogen doped TiO2 thin film (NTTF) synthesized by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, was used as the working anode. The crystalline, optical properties, surface morphology, and structure of the NTTF were characterized by XRD, UV\u2013vis absorbance edges, SEM, and XPS. Results showed that the NTTF was dominated by anatase phase after sintered at 600\u00b0C with significant visible light response at 595nm. XPS analyses indicated nitrogen doping was mainly responsible for reducing the band gap as evidence of 3% N doping into the structure via the linkage of TiON and NTiO bond. SEM images illustrated the nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanoparticles being attached firmly and spread evenly over the ITO glass surface, which is beneficial for PEC applications. The degradation efficiency of MO by photoelectrochemical, photocatalytic, electrochemical and photolysis methods were compared in terms of pseudo-first-order reaction rate. PEC was the most efficient in degrading MO at a bias potential of 2.0V (vs. SCE) under light at a wavelength of 325nm, which was consistent with results of IPCE (%) measurements. The synergetic effect was quantified at current/bias potential of 0.07mA/0.3V and 0.6mA/2.0V, respectively. Results demonstrated that the bias potential could separate photogenerated holes and electrons effectively and enhance the electrochemical-oxidation of MO. The mechanistic aspects of MO degradation by the PEC process were discussed.", "Ag/TiO2 composite films with the different Ag contents of 1, 3, and 5vol.% were deposited at 25, 200, and 400\u00b0C on glass substrates by radio frequency sputtering with a single cermet target formed by hot pressing the Ag nanoparticle-decorated TiO2 nanopowder at 900\u00b0C in argon atmosphere for 30min, followed by annealing in air and the reduction under vacuum heating or by NaBH4. All the TiO2 films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction technique to have an amorphous structure. High deposition and annealing temperatures all led to Ag aggregation in Ag/TiO2. Photodegradation of acid black 1 dye was used as the screen test to evaluate the photocatalytic ability of Ag/TiO2 films, before the antibacterial test was preceded. The antibacterial ability on Escherichia coli was also evaluated. The 25\u00b0C-deposited 3% Ag/TiO2 films of 80nm in thickness had the best performance in optical transmittance above 70% and killing the E. coli. The mechanism for the fluorescent lamp-induced bactericide of the 3% Ag/TiO2 film is proposed. The amorphous 3% Ag/TiO2 film had larger band gap of 3.67eV than the annealed ones and is expected not to be excited by the fluorescent lamp, but to prolong the lifetime of the thermally induced, not photo-induced, charge carriers in the Ag/TiO2 by its electric field of the illumination light and the attraction by Ag nanoparticles 8nm in size. The Ag+ release mechanism for bactericide is not the major one here after comparing with the tests in the dark.", "The present study describes cathodoluminescence (CL) properties of CaSnO3 phosphors doped with Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+ synthesized by a solid-state method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm that CaSnO3 sintered at 1200\u00b0C exhibits orthorhombic structure. The evidence and rationale for two strong broad emission bands appeared at 360 and 780nm for undoped CaSnO3 are presented. The CL measurements exhibit that the 4f\u20134f emissions from 5D4\u21927F6 (490nm), 5D4 \u21927F5 (544nm), 5D4 \u21927F4 (586nm) and 5D4 \u21927F3 (622nm), assigned to possible transitions of Tb3+ ions are seen. The strongest one, observed at 544nm, due to its probability of both magnetic and electric transitions make the sample emission green. Emissions at 480, 574, 662 and 755nm were detected for the CaSnO3:Dy3+ and attributed to the transitions from the 4 F 9/2 to various energy levels 6 H 15/2, 6 H 13/2, 6 H 11/2 and 6 H 9/2+6 F 11/2 of Dy3+, respectively. CL spectra of Eu doped CaSnO3 reveal that there is a strong emission peak appeared at 615nm due to the electric dipole transition 5D0\u21927F2 (red). Finally, our results show that the rare earth doped CaSnO3 have remarkable potential for applications as optical materials since it exhibits efficient and sharp emission due to rare earth ions.", "The effect of different bottom electrode structures (Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si and Pt/Zr/SiO2/Si) and Pt deposition temperatures on the properties of ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering and crystallized either in the furnace or by RTA was investigated. The orientation of the films was strongly affected by all those parameters in the case of Ti adhesion layer, whereas for Zr only a slight effect could be detected. The best ferroelectric properties were obtained for Pt/Ti bottom electrodes with the Pt deposited at 500\u00b0C and for Pt/Zr bottom electrodes with the Pt made at room temperature, in both cases the PZT being crystallized in the furnace. The results are explained in terms of different stress levels and diffusion processes taking place in the bottom electrode structures during their deposition and the crystallization of the PZT thin films.", "Transparent and conducting zirconium-doped zinc oxide films with high transparency and relatively low resistivity have been successfully prepared by RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The deposition pressure was varied from 0.6 to 2.5Pa. A transformation from a relatively compact structure to individual grains was observed with the increase of deposition pressure. As the deposition pressure increases, the resistivity increases sharply due to both, the decrease of hall mobility and carrier concentration. The lowest resistivity achieved was 2.07\u00d710\u22123\u03a9cm at a deposition pressure of 0.6Pa with a hall mobility of 16cm2V\u22121s\u22121 and a carrier concentration of 1.95\u00d71020cm\u22123. The films are polycrystalline with a hexagonal structure and a preferred orientation along the c-axis. All the films present a high transmittance of above 90% in the visible range. The optical band gap decreases from 3.35 to 3.20eV as the deposition pressure increases from 0.6 to 2.5Pa.", "Ferroelectric strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) thin films were deposited by thermal metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) onto a complex layered Pt/IrO2/Ir/Ti(Al)N substrate. A study of ultra-violet (UV)-assisted rapid thermal processing (RTP) annealing strategies of the SBT thin films was performed. The influence of UV irradiation temperature and annealing atmosphere on the crystallinity of the deposited films was evaluated using both microstructural and electrical analysis techniques. A UV-RTP strategy in an oxygen atmosphere above 400\u00b0C, followed by a furnace treatment at 700\u00b0C, provided an optimum remnant polarization figure of merit.", "TiO2 thin film was deposited on non-heated Si(100) substrate by RF magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited films were annealed by a conventional thermal annealing (CTA) and rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 700 and 800\u00b0C, and the effects of annealing temperature and method on optical properties of studied films were investigated by measuring the optical band gaps and FT-IR spectra. And we also compared the XRD patterns of the studied samples. The as-deposited film showed a mixed structure of anatase and brookite. Only rutile structures were found in samples annealed above 800\u00b0C by CTA, while there are no special peaks except the weak brookite B(232) peak for the sample annealed at (or above) 800\u00b0C by RTA. FT-IR spectra show the broad peaks due to Ti\u2013O vibration mode in the range of 590\u2013620cm\u22121 for the as-deposited film as well as samples annealed by both annealing methods at 700\u00b0C. The studied samples all had the peaks from Si\u2013O vibration mode, which seemed to be due to the reaction between TiO2 and Si substrate, and the intensities of these peaks increased with increasing of annealing temperature. The optical band gap of the as-deposited film was 3.29eV but it varied from 3.39 to 3.43eV as the annealing temperature increased from 700 to 800\u00b0C in the samples annealed by CTA. However, it varied from 3.38 to 3.32eV as the annealing temperature increased from 700 to 800\u00b0C by RTA.", "A series of (Fe65Co35\u00b12)x\u2013(SiO1.7\u00b10.2)1\u2212x nano-granular films with various metal volume fractions (x) were fabricated by rf sputtering. In a wide range, excellent soft magnetic properties have been achieved. In the x range from 0.7 to 0.48, the films exhibit small coercivity Hc not exceeding 4Oe and high electrical resistivity \u03c1 up to 1.15\u00d7104\u03bc\u03a9cm. And a minimum Hc value of 1.65Oe was obtained for the sample of x=0.57 with \u03c1=2.86\u00d7103\u03bc\u03a9cm. At a frequency lower than 2.0GHz, the real part \u03bc\u2032 of complex permeability of this sample is more than 170 and the FMR frequency is as high as 2.6GHz, implying a high cut-off frequency for high frequency applications. With decreasing Fe65Co35\u00b12 volume fraction, the resistivity of films increases remarkably and the grain size decreases obviously. At the same time, the coercivity Hc decreases with grain size decreasing, which is consistent with the conclusion resulted from random anisotropy model quoted by Herzer. Study on Henkel plots shows that intergranular ferromagnetic exchange coupling exists among grains and is important for realizing soft magnetic properties.", "High quality Cd1\u2212xFexSe thin films with different Fe content were grown on sapphire substrates by using low-pressure metal organic chemical vapor deposition (LP-MOCVD). The structural properties of these films were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Temperature dependent spectra were also used to study the origin of the emission peak. Strong near band emission (NBE) without other defect related emission at room temperature demonstrates that the thin films have high optical quality. Absorption spectra were used to estimate the band gap of the Cd1\u2212xFexSe films.", "A series of (Fe57Co24Ni4Nb2B13)x\u2013(SiO2)1\u2212x nano-granular thin films were fabricated by magnetron sputtering with different oblique incidence angle \u03b8 and excellent soft magnetic properties are achieved. Based on the results of magnetic field anneal at different temperature Ta, it is evidenced that orientation of atomic pairs contributes to the annealing treatment, and could manipulate magnetic anisotropy. The damping coefficient \u03b1 decreases with increasing angle \u03b8 and this is ascribed to the anisotropy dissipation.", "This paper deals with the experimental investigation of the structure and magnetic properties of thin polycrystalline Fe films. Two sets of 50\u00b12nm thick Fe films were fabricated on Si\u3008100\u3009 substrates with native oxides in place by varying (i) the sputter pressure pAr and (ii) the Fe sputter power PFe. X-ray diffraction (XRD) study revealed that all films grew with strong \u3008110\u3009 texture normal to the film plane. No higher order peaks were observed in any of the films studied. For both film sets, the lattice constant (a) was less than the bulk Fe lattice constant (a0=2.866\u00c5), which suggested the existence of compressive strain in all films. Two regions of homogeneous strain were observed over the range of pAr studied. Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements showed that all films exhibited magnetically isotropic behaviour. The magnetic properties were observed to be influenced strongly by pAr. The film grown at pAr=4\u03bcbar was the most softest (Hs=100\u00b18 kAm\u22121, Mr/Ms=0.87\u00b10.02) film among all the films studied. The magnetic properties were found to be independent of PFe. The effective saturation magnetostriction constant \u03bbeff determined (using the Villari method) was positive (4\u00b11ppm) and observed to vary within the calculated error.", "In this work, we report on the effect of Cr incorporation on the microstructural and optical properties of TiO2:Cr thin films deposited by the RF-magnetron sputtering method. The structural, morphological, chemical bonding and optoelectronic properties of the sputter-deposited TiO2:Cr films were systematically investigated, as a function the incorporated Cr content, by means of various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier-Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) absorption, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and ellipsometry. The Cr incorporation into the TiO2 films was controlled by adjusting the RF power (PCr) on the Cr target during the co-sputtering process of TiO2 and Cr. We were thus able to demonstrate that by varying PCr from 8W to 150W, the Cr content of the TiO2:Cr films can be fairly controlled from \u223c2at.% to \u223c18at.% and their associated bandgap engineered from 3.3eV to 1.5eV. The room-temperature deposited TiO2:Cr are mainly amorphous with the presence of some TiO2 nanocrystallites, and their density increases as their Cr content is increased. The Cr inclusions were found to coexist under both metallic and oxidized forms in the films. By subjecting the TiO2:Cr films to post-annealing treatment (at 550\u00b0C), their crystalline structure was found to be sensitive to their Cr content. Indeed, an anatase-to-rutile phase transformation has been pointed out to occur at a Cr content of \u223c7at.%. Likewise, the Cr-content dependence of the bandgap of annealed TiO2:Cr films undergoes a transition around the 7at.% of Cr. Our results demonstrate the ability to control the Cr-content of TiO2:Cr films, which leads to tune their optoelectronic properties, such as bandgap or optical absorption edge.", "Fe films were deposited on nanochannel Al2O3 substrates at 300K by direct current magnetron sputtering with the oblique target. The film thickness is 100nm, 120nm, 175nm and 325nm. All the films consist of granules and grow with a network structure. The network structure is formed by granule connection. The granule consists of many fine grains. The granule size increases with increasing film thickness. The transverse width of the granule gradually widens along the film growing direction. The 120nm-thick film has a honeycomb-like network structure. The network films have a resistivity of about 7\u00d710\u22125\u03a9m. A temperature dependence of the resistivity within 1.5\u2013200K reveals that the Fe network films exhibit a minimal resistivity at about 30K. A logarithmic temperature dependence of the conductance is verified at temperatures below 30K. The 100nm-thick film exhibits the weakest magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetic uniaxial anisotropy. The 120nm-thick film has the lowest coercivity.", "Pure zinc oxide (ZnO) and lead (Pb) doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Pb) films with different Pb doping concentrations were deposited on glass substrate by using radio frequency reactive magnetron sputtering technique. X-ray diffraction spectroscopy measurements showed that all samples with the (100) preferential orientation were growth of the non-polar. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggested that the Pb ions were successfully doped into lattice of ZnO and the valence of Pb in the ZnO films was a mixed state of +2 and +4. Optical band gaps of the ZnO:Pb were 3.24, 2.92, 2.86 and 2.74eV with the increase of Pb doping concentration, it could attribute this red shift phenomenon to the decrease of carrier concentration. Photoluminescence measurements showed that a broad emission band including the two blue emission peaks are about at 437nm and 470nm, one green and red emission peaks are about at 510nm and 710nm, which may compound white light. Moreover, growth of non-polar ZnO enhanced enormously the luminous efficiency of photoluminescence in our experiment. The current\u2013voltage measurements between two surface electrodes showed the increase in resistance with increase of Pb doping concentration.", "The L10 FePt\u2013MgO/Fe\u2013MgO bilayers were fabricated on thermal oxide silicon substrate by using magnetron sputtering. The TEM image shows that the FePt\u2013MgO single layer has small and uniform granular grain. In the FePt\u2013MgO/Fe\u2013MgO bilayer system, with increasing Fe layer thickness, the grain size become larger and the grain boundary become obscure, while the magnetization process transforms from a coherent magnetization to an exchange spring behavior, and finally a two-phase magnetization reversible process.", "Cu\u2013Cr\u2013O films were prepared using reactive magnetron sputtering deposition followed by annealing at temperatures ranging from 550 to 625\u00b0C in 25\u00b0C increments. Correlations between the optoelectronic and microstructural properties of the p-type CuCrO2 films are discussed. The as-deposited film was amorphous; after annealing at 550 and 575\u00b0C, films adopted mixed CuO and CuCr2O4 phases. Annealing at 600\u00b0C led to the formation of a dominant phase of delafossite CuCrO2. The 625\u00b0C-annealed film was single-phase CuCrO2 which had a bar- and polygonal-like mixed surface appearance, with a root mean square roughness of 17.7nm. CuCrO2 is an intrinsic p-type semiconductor which exhibits electrical conductivity and transparency over the visible wavelength range. Two higher-energy subband transitions at 3.69 and 4.82eV were observed in the band structure of CuCrO2. Point defects were the main reason source of hole carrier scattering in the material. The single-phase CuCrO2 film had the lowest resistivity of the films, 4.31\u03a9cm, and had a direct band gap of 3.14eV and light transmittance of 62% at 600nm.", "N-doped TiO2 film was deposited by RF reactive magnetron sputtering in a mixture gas of N2, O2 and Ar. The experimental results show that the crystal structure is anatase phase, and the concentration of substitutional nitrogen is 4.91at.% which leads to a narrow optical band gap of 2.65eV. The H2 production rate of the N-doped TiO2 film is about 601\u03bcmolg\u22121h\u22121, far higher than that of the undoped TiO2 film and even about 50 times higher than that of dispersive P25 powder.", "We report effects of post-annealing on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) thin films by their physical, electrical, optical, and electronic properties. Carrier concentrations increase up to annealing temperatures of 400\u00b0C, and then decrease at higher annealing temperatures. Burstein\u2013Moss effect occurs as a function of annealing temperature with the highest optical bandgap of 4.17eV achieved at 400\u00b0C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a \u223c0.3eV shift in the Fermi level of the annealed ITO films at 400\u00b0C, and the shift was reduced for temperatures higher than 400\u00b0C. In addition, the results of curve-fitting for the core levels showed a change of ratios of SnO2 and oxygen in the oxygen deficient regions after annealing. This is correlated to the change of carrier concentration and optical bandgap in the ultraviolet and near-infrared regions at different annealing temperatures.", "Thin films of zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) were deposited on Si(111) substrates using radio frequency magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The effect of thermal annealing under vacuum with magnetic field on structural and magnetic properties of Zn ferrite films has been investigated as a function of post-annealed temperature. The saturation magnetization at room temperature was enhanced up to 256emu/cm3 by annealing at relatively low temperature of 200\u00b0C and decreased at higher temperatures. The complex permeability \u03bc=\u03bc\u2032\u2212i\u03bc\u2033 values of the ferrite films as-deposited and annealed at 200 and 400\u00b0C were measured at frequency up to 4GHz. These films exhibited better high-frequency properties, especially, the film annealed at 200\u00b0C had a large \u03bc\u2032 of 16 and high resonance frequency fr of 1.48GHz. The results showed that the Zn ferrite film annealed at 200\u00b0C could be used as core inductors in the electromagnetic devices.", "Spinel AB2O4 oxide Mn1.4Co1.0Ni0.6O4 (MCN) films are fabricated on Al2O3 amorphous substrate by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering method at different sputtering powers. The surface morphology and microstructure of the films are studied by SEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction. A major advance is the sputtering deposition of highly oriented MCN thin films. Variable temperature electrical properties of the as-grown and post annealed samples are investigated in 230\u2013325K temperature range. The dependence of electrical properties on growth conditions is discussed in detail. The resistivity of annealed MCN films is about 240\u2013250\u03a9cm with a negative temperature coefficient of about 4%K\u22121 at room temperature, which is a breakthrough for thermal sensing application by RF sputtering method. Optical properties of the MCN samples are studied within 0.33-10\u03bcm band, and the optical bandgaps for the as-grown and post annealed MCN samples are about 0.51eV and 0.57eV, respectively.", "Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin films with 250nm thickness had been prepared on soda-lime glass substrate without heated by RF magnetron sputtering using a ceramic target. The microstructure, surface morphology, electrical and optical properties of AZO thin films had been investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, four-point probe method and optical transmission spectroscopy. The results indicated that all of the films obtained were polycrystalline with a hexagonal structure and oriented with the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate.

The effect of TiO2 incorporation on the interfacial chemical structure and energy-band discontinuities has been investigated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis). It has been found that the band gap and band offsets of the Hf1\u2212xTixO2 thin film decrease with the increase of TiO2 concentration. Meanwhile, the obtained band offsets are all over 1eV. Thin film capacitors fabricated with the MOS configuration of Al/Hf1\u2212xTixO2/n-Si/Al exhibits excellent electrical properties with low interface state density, hysteresis voltage and low leakage current density. The suitable band gap, symmetrical band offsets relative to Si and prominent electrical properties render sputtering-derived Hf1\u2212xTixO2 with 9% TiO2 films as promising candidates for high-k gate dielectrics.", "The lead titanate thin films were deposited using in situ layer-by-layer reactive magnetron sputtering. The synthesis of films was performed on platinized silicon (Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si) substrates at 450\u2013600\u00b0C temperatures using Ti2O seed layer. The influence of the substrate temperature on the surface morphology, phase composition, and electrical properties of PbTiO3 films were investigated. Experimental results demonstrated that the deposition at higher substrate temperatures resulted in the formation of films with the lower surface roughness values. The increase of the substrate temperature has no effect on the tetragonality value of the films. The preferential orientation in the films was changed and the crystallites size slightly increased with the increased substrate temperature from 450\u00b0C to 550\u00b0C. Hysteresis measurements show that the films exhibit ferroelectric properties with a maximum coercive field of Ec=150kV/cm and of Pr=60\u03bcC/cm2. Coercive field dependence on the frequency measurements indicated that the creep regime of domain wall motions dominated till 1kHz of frequency.", "Gallium and aluminium co-doped zinc oxide (GAZO) thin films were prepared on glass substrates at low temperatures by radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering and their physical properties were investigated. All films possessed a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure with a strong growth orientation along the (002) c-axis. The (002) peak intensity and mean crystallite size increased with substrate temperature from room temperature (RT) to 75\u00b0C and then decreased at 100\u00b0C, indicating an improvement in crystallinity up to 75\u00b0C and its deterioration at 100\u00b0C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs revealed the strong dependency of surface morphology on substrate temperature and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the incorporation of Ga and Al into the ZnO films. All films exhibited excellent transmittances between 85 and 90% in the visible region and their optical band gap increased from 3.22eV to 3.28eV with substrate temperature. The Urbach energy decreased from 194meV to 168meV with increasing substrate temperature, indicating a decrease in structural disorders which was consistent with X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis.

Resistivity and scattering time resulting from fitting to measurements are found to depend on the spectral range modeled, such that the inclusion of increasingly longer wavelengths results in a convergence to direct electrical property measurements.", "Zn-Ti-O thin films with different concentrations of titanium were deposited by reactive magnetron co-sputtering in a reactive Ar/O2 atmosphere from zinc and titanium targets. It was found that with increasing Ti content the structure of the films gradually changes from a fully crystalline pure ZnO wurtzite structure with a strongly preferred columnar orientation to an amorphous Zn-Ti-O material with 12.5at.% Ti. The optical parameters (spectral refractive index and extinction coefficient, optical band gap) and thickness of the films were analysed by the combined evaluation of ellipsometric measurements and measurements of transmittance on a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer. For evaluation of optical parameters was used Cody-Lorentz dispersion model.", "The (001) surface of cubic silicon carbide (3C SiC) after cleaning, Ar sputtering and three different wet chemical etching procedures was thoroughly investigated via (angle resolved) XPS, HREELS, and LEED. While Ar sputtering was found to be unsuitable for surface preparation, all three employed wet chemical etching procedures (piranha/NH4F, piranha/HF, and RCA) provide a clean surface. HF as oxide removal agent tends to result in fluorine traces on the sample surface, despite thorough rinsing. All procedures yield a 1\u00d71 Si\u2013OH/C\u2013H terminated surface. However, the XPS spectra reveal some differences in the resulting surface states. NH4F for oxide removal produces a flat band situation, whereas the other two procedures result in a slight downward (HF) or upward (RCA) band bending. Because the band bending is small, it can be concluded that the number of unsaturated surface defects is low.", "Highly oriented and locally epitaxial multiferroic YCrO3 (001) thin films, 20nm thick, were deposited by r.f. magnetron sputtering on SrTiO3 (110) substrates at 890\u00b0C. The structure was investigated by x-ray diffraction and cross section high resolution transmition electron microscopy, a clear local matching between the YCrO3 film and the substrate was observed. Ferroelectricity was confirmed by means of switching areas with opposite polarization directions, first and second harmonic electromechanical signals, and local hysteresis ferroelectric curves obtained by piezoresponse force microscopy. Additionally, below the N\u00e9el temperature, a clear ferromagnetic hysteresis loop was observed. These results will encourage further studies on the mechanism that promotes the ferroelectric nature in YCrO3 compound.", "MnCoGe thin films were produced using simultaneous magnetron sputtering of Mn, Co, and Ge on SiO2, followed by non-diffusive reaction. The MnCoGe compound begins to form at \u223c588\u202fK, and structural characterizations show that the obtained MnCoGe film is polycrystalline with the hexagonal Ni2In-type structure. This structure is found to be stable from 873\u202fK down to room temperature, the expected hexagonal/orthorhombic structural transition being prevented. The film exhibits a lower average Mn composition than the standard MnCoGe stoichiometry. Furthermore, small clusters (<3\u202fnm) forming planar distributions parallel to the sample surface are observed. They are regularly located every \u223c11\u202fnm in the specimen depth. They mainly contain Mn and O atoms. Magnetic characterizations show very good magnetic properties, allowing the perpendicular and parallel magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants to be measured down to 100\u202fK, using the Chappert model to fit ferromagnetic resonance measurements. The film magnetic properties match the properties of bulk stoichiometric MnCoGe in the hexagonal structure, with a Curie temperature of \u223c269\u202fK and a negligible coercive field at room temperature. The only difference between the magnetic properties of bulk and thin film specimens appears to be the film shape anisotropy, forcing the internal magnetic field to be contained in the film plane.", "Polycrystalline ferrite nano-powders, Ni1 \u2212 x Cu x Fe2O4 (where x =0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8) were synthesized by using egg white route at 520\u00b0C for 6h, then pre-sintered and sintered into ceramics under 800\u00b0C for 3h and 900\u00b0C for 3h, respectively. X-ray diffraction, laser particle size analyzer, TEM, vibrating sample magnetometer, SEM and precision impedance analyzer were carried out to investigate phase formation, microstructural and influence of Cu content on magnetic and electrical properties of Ni\u2013Cu ferrite samples.

The effect of Cu concentration on saturation magnetization and coercive force were calculated from hysteresis loop, the maximum value of saturation magnetization was 39.46emu/g. Electrical resistivity, dielectric constant, dielectric loss tangent and permeability were measured from 10MHz to 110MHz. Two main contributing factors decrease the electrical properties: the reduction of the fraction of the grain boundary and the electron hopping mechanism between Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. All results indicated that the Cu content has a significant influence on the properties.", "Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were prepared by d.c. (direct current) or r.f. (radio frequency) magnetron sputtering on glass substrates. The structural, electrical and optical properties of the films were studied. It has been found that most films produced by d.c. sputtering are not electrically conductive or have a high resistance above 10 \u03a9m, while the films produced using r.f. sputtering are significantly more conductive. The optical transmittance at 550 nm is around 80% or higher for most films. The energy band gaps of the ZnO films prepared by d.c. sputtering are smaller than the films prepared by r.f. sputtering. It is also found that the films prepared using an electrical bias have higher resistivity than those produced without bias. It has been observed by SEM that the conductive films show less porosity between the grains than the poor conductive films. Conductive ZnO films show a smaller d spacing than the non-conductive films. The results reveal that crystal microstructure and density of the ZnO films affect their conductivity.", "Zinc oxide films were prepared by rf magnetron sputtering on glass substrates with designed ZnO target using high-purity of zinc oxide (99.99%) powder. Systematic study on dependence of target-to-substrate distance (D ts) on structural, electrical and optical properties of the as-grown ZnO films was mainly investigated in this work. XRD showed that highly preferred ZnO crystal in the [001] direction was grown in parallel to the substrate, while the D ts did not effect to the peak position of XRD. With decreasing D ts, the growth rate is increased while the electrical resistivity as well as crystal size in the ZnO films was decreased. The XPS data showed that the O/Zn ratio in ZnO films was increased with increasing D ts in the films. The as-grown ZnO films have an average transmittance of above 85% at the visible region. The optical band gap of the as-grown ZnO films was changed from 3.18 to 3.36 eV with D ts. With decreasing D ts, the electrical resistivity was decreased, while the growth rate was increased.A bilayer is used as an anode electrode for organic electroluminescent devices. The bilayer consists of an ultrathin ZnO layer adjacent to a hole-transporting layer and an Indium tin oxide (ITO) outerlayer.

Their electrical properties with respect to temperature and frequency were examined and the effect of sintering conditions on phase formation, densification, microstructure and electrical properties of the ceramics were examined. It has been found that optimisation of sintering condition can lead to a highly dense and pyrochlore-free PMN\u2013PT ceramics. The gradual decreasing of the physical properties of the sintered ceramics was related to the gradual decrease of density and inhomogeneous microstructure. The results also revealed that for the lower concentration of lead titanate a relaxor behavior is noticed with a high electrostrictive effect, which was almost hysteretic free. However, higher amount of lead titanate led to a normal ferroelectric behavior.", "The nitrogen and aluminium-codoped ZnO (NAZO) thin films are grown by rf magnetron sputtering system with the nitrogen flow ratio changing from 0% to 30%.

The optical transmittance spectra indicate an average transmittance of about 95% in the visible range, and a red shift of the band gap energy is observed with increasing the nitrogen flow ratio.

The samples were sintered at 950 \u00b0C for 30 min. Microstuctural and structural analyses were carried out using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The lattice parameter was found to increase with increasing nickel concentration. The porosity calculated using X-ray density and measured density also shows a decreasing behavior with increasing nickel concentration. The variation of saturation magnetization was studied as a function of nickel concentration. All the compositions indicate that they are ferrimagnetic in nature. Initial permeability plotted against temperature at 10 kHz showed a sharp drop at Curie transition temperature and values observed at transition are found to be dependent on the nickel concentration. The dielectric constant, dielectric loss tangent and ac conductivity of all samples were measured at room temperature as a function of frequency. These parameters decrease with increase in frequency for all of the samples. The present ferrites are well suitable for the application in multilayer chip inductor due to its low temperature sinterability, good magnetic properties and low loss at high frequency.", "Mn-doped BiFeO3 (BFMO) films with various thicknesses were deposited on Pt(111) and SrRuO3(SRO)/Pt(111) bottom electrodes using radio-frequency (RF) sputtering at 550\u00a0\u00b0C. As the thickness of BFMO films was decreased, the coercive voltages (V c) decreased while the coercive fields increased in the films on both Pt and SRO/Pt bottom electrodes. At a BFMO film thickness of 70\u00a0nm formed on the SRO/Pt(111) electrode, V c was reduced to 3.4\u00a0V, while the remanent polarization was kept at a value as large as 56\u00a0\u03bcC/cm2.", "Composites of 0.99La0.7(Cax Sr1\u2013x )0.3MnO3/0.01SnO2 (LCSMO/SnO2) (x\u00a0=\u00a00, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7 and 1) were synthesized using solid-state reaction technique, and then characterized using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD and SEM observations show the LCSMO and SnO2 phases are separately distributed in the composites which indicate that there was no chemical interaction occurred during the sintering process. SnO2 is mainly distributed at the grain boundaries and surfaces of the matrix. The resistivity of the composites was measured in the range of 100\u2013350\u00a0K by using physical properties measurement system (PPMS).

The optical transmittance of FZTO films was higher than 80% in all specimens. Work function (\u03d5) of the FZTO films increase from 3.80 eV to 4.10 eV through annealing and are largely dependent on the amounts of incorporated F. FZTO is a possible potential transparent conducting oxide (TCO) alternative for application in optoelectronics.", "Graphene films grown by chemical vapor deposition on copper foils were hydrogenated using commercially viable methods. Parameters such as plasma power, plasma frequency, and sample temperature were varied to determine the maximum possible hydrogenation without etching the film. The kinetic energy of the ions inside the plasma is critical, in that higher kinetic energy ions tend to etch the film while lower kinetic energy ions participate in the hydrogenation process. The film sheet resistance was shown to increase, while the hole mobility was shown to decrease with increasing hydrogenation. Variable temperature measurements demonstrate a transition from semi-metallic behavior for graphene to semiconducting behavior for hydrogenated graphene. Sheet resistance measurements as a function of temperature also suggest the emergence of a bandgap in the hydrogenated graphene films.", "Graphene CVD-grown on Cu has been studied using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Raman data indicate the presence of weak compressive strain at the interface of graphene/Cu. Compared with highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), new electronic states in the conduction band are observed for graphene/Cu, which are mainly ascribed to the defect states and interfacial interaction between the single graphene layer and Cu surface. Moreover, polarization dependent XAS measurements demonstrate that the graphene/Cu exhibits a high degree of alignment and weak corrugation on the surface. Significant intensity modulation in the resonant XES spectral shape upon different excitation energies near the C K-edge indicates that graphene layer preserves an intrinsic momentum as that of HOPG and the interaction between graphene and Cu shows weak influence on the valence band structure of graphene. However, broad inelastic features and subtle peak shifts are observed in the resonant XES spectra of graphene/Cu in comparison of HOPG, which can be mainly attributed to the electron\u2013phonon scattering and charge transfer from the interfacial interaction of graphene and Cu substrate.", "Iron-filled nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe@CNx) nanotubes were prepared by an in situ chemical vapor deposition with ferrocene as catalyst and ethylenediamine as carbon and nitrogen sources. The as-grown products were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer, transmission electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analyzer and vibrating sample magnetometer. It was found that the \u201cbamboo-like\u201d N-doped carbon nanotubes were filled with 41.1wt% of Fe nanoparticles. The coercivity and saturation magnetization of Fe@CNx nanotubes were much larger than those of carbon nanotubes and CNx nanotubes.", "We report an advanced chemical vapour deposition approach which yields not previously observed carbon-based foam-like films completely filled with a single phase of \u03b1-Fe. These films are found in the region of the chemical vapour deposition reactor where the temperature is relatively low (650\u2013770\u00a0\u00b0C) and exhibit a high saturation magnetization as high as 200\u2013220 emu/g at room temperature when small concentrations of Cl-radicals are added to the pyrolysing CVD system by mixing 0.15\u00a0ml of dichlorobenzene to ferrocene. Instead when the only ferrocene is used a lower saturation magnetization of 140\u2013145 emu/g is found due to an amorphous arrangement of the Fe-phase in some parts of the foam. Also we show that for much higher concentration of Cl radicals (0.65\u00a0ml of dichlorobenzene mixed to ferrocene) a dramatic decrease of the quantity of crystalline \u03b1-Fe is found together with the formation of amorphous Fe and FexOx phases.", "BackgroundLevetiracetam (Keppra) is a novel antiepileptic drug recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an add-on therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients. We developed and describe a simple and rapid high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) assay for the determination of levetiracetam in human matrix (plasma, serum, or saliva).MethodsAn API-3000 or API-4000 triple\u2013quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Concord, Canada) coupled with the IonSpray source and Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD) was used employing ritonavir as internal standard (IS) for levetiracetam. One hundred microliters of serum (or plasma, saliva) was deproteinized by adding 150\u00a0\u03bcl of acetonitrile containing internal standard. After centrifugation, 100\u00a0\u03bcl of supernatant was diluted with 300\u00a0\u03bcl of water and 10\u00a0\u03bcl aliquot was injected onto a C-18 column. After a 2.5\u00a0min wash the valve was activated to initiate the isocratic elution program which eluted the levetiracetam and internal standard into the MS/MS system. Quantitation by MRM analysis was performed in the positive ion mode. Within-day and between-day imprecision were evaluated for levetiracetam using three levels of in-house controls. Reliability and accuracy of this method were assessed by comparison of targets with external QC material (ChromSystems), between laboratory comparisons and by recovery studies.ResultsWithin-day coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6.1% and between-day CVs were 8.2%. The average spiked recoveries of levetiracetam added to the drug-free human plasma samples were 108% at low concentration level and 103% at high concentration level.ConclusionsThe method was found both specific and sensitive for the rapid and accurate measurement of levetiracetam in human matrices and correlated well with the Quest/Chantilly tandem mass spectrometric method (r =0.983).", "BackgroundThyroxin (T4) plays an important role in the regulation of the rate of metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Congenital hypothyroidism, an inherited deficiency of thyroid hormones, is screened in newborns using a variety of methods that include total T4 or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Some laboratories measure either total T4 or TSH as a means of detecting infants with hypothyroidism with a subset that analyzes both total T4 and TSH as a primary screen or a combination of primary and secondary screens.MethodsWe have developed a new MS/MS method that measures T4 from a filter paper blood spot following methanol extraction using the essentially the same method as MS/MS analysis of amino acids. Product ion spectra show a transition of 833.8\u2192731.8 (102\u00a0Da). An SRM for T4 and 13C6\u2013T4 was added to the MS/MS analysis of acylcarnitines and amino acids.ResultsAnalysis of T4 by MS/MS compares well with the immunoassay. The mean of 10,225 newborn screening specimens was 14.4\u00a0\u03bcg/dl (range 2.4\u201333) for MS/MS and 16.9\u00a0\u03bcg/dl (range 1.4\u201371.8) for AutoDELFIA. The MS/MS assay was linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.998. Regression analysis of MS/MS with the AutoDELFIA had a slope of 0.7, a y-intercept of 3.25, and a correlation coefficient of 0.727. We determined a MS/MS detection limit of 0.97\u00a0\u03bcg/dl and a lower LoQ (limit of quantification) of 2\u00a0\u03bcg/dl.ConclusionThis method may provide a cost effective means of analyzing both T4 and TSH by consolidating a T4 analysis into the MS/MS panel.", "BackgroundNon-cellulose dried matrix spotting (DMS) cards are an alternative to filter paper (FP) for bloodspots. We compared the interpatient distributions of bloodspot areas between DMS and FP for a fixed volume of application of whole blood, and examined correlations of areas with hematocrit.MethodsEDTA-whole blood adult patient samples (n =49; 25 males, 24 females) were utilized after routine measurement of hemoglobin and hematocrit. Replicate (4\u00d7) bloodspots were produced by bolus drop application of 50\u03bcL whole blood via a fixed-volume pipettor to either FP or DMS. Dried bloodspot areas were determined by image analysis.ResultsHematocrits (HCT) were normally distributed (HCT=30.9\u00b15.3%). For both FP and DMS, bloodspot areas (a, cm2) across patients were normally distributed: for FP, a =1.11\u00b10.056cm2 (\u00b15.0%); for DMS, a =0.378\u00b10.037cm2 (\u00b19.9%). Relative bloodspot area differences across the population range were 20% for both DMS and FP. Correlation of bloodspot areas to hematocrit was negative for FP (r =\u22120.80) but positive for DMS (r =+0.78).ConclusionsInterpatient variation in blood volume per area is a preanalytical variable for both DMS and FP bloodspots. Hematocrit is but one interpatient variable, as correlations of fixed-volume bloodspot areas with hematocrit across patients were substantially inexact (r 2 0.65).", "Polycrystalline cobalt-substituted lithium ferrites with general formula Li0.5\u2212x/2CoxFe2.5\u2212x/2O4 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.5) were prepared by a non-conventional citrate precursor method, which is advantageous over conventional (solid state sintering) method because of low temperature (600\u00b0C) processing. Small amounts of Bi2O3 (0.5wt.%) were added to reduce the porosity and dielectric loss tangent at sintering temperatures (1000\u20131200\u00b0C). The complex magnetic permeability (\u03bc\u2032 \u2212 j\u03bc\u2033) and complex dielectric permittivity (\u03f5\u2032 \u2212 j\u03f5\u2033) of cobalt-substituted lithium ferrites were measured in the 8\u201313GHz microwave frequency range. The systematic variations of the real and imaginary parts of both permeability and permittivity with frequency and composition have been analyzed. The minimum value of \u03f5\u2032 \u223c 11.3 measured for x = 0.4 substituted lithium ferrite is observed for a sample sintered at 1000\u00b0C. The highest values of \u03f5\u2032 and \u03f5\u2033 were observed for samples sintered at 1200\u00b0C. \u03bc\u2032 varies between 1.84 and 3.90 for pure and cobalt-substituted lithium ferrite bulk ceramics. The spinel structure of the samples was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).", "CeO2-doped lead-free Bi0.5Na0.44K0.06TiO3 piezoelectric ceramics (0\u20131.0wt%) were synthesized by conventional ceramics technique. X-ray diffraction shows that CeO2 diffuses into the lattice of Bi0.5Na0.44K0.06TiO3 to form a solid solution, but does not change the rhombohedral phase in Bi0.5Na0.44K0.06TiO3 during sintering. The temperature dependence of dielectric constant \u025br and dielectric loss tan\u03b4 measurement reveals that the solid solutions experience two phase transitions from ferroelectric to anti-ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric to paraelectric, which can be proved by P\u2013E hysteresis loops at different temperatures. The specimen containing 0.2wt% CeO2 shows that the coercive field Ec decreases from 8.22 to 4.76kV/mm while the remnant polarization Pr decreases from 37.2 to 30.0\u03bcC/cm2, corresponding to the enhancement of piezoelectric constant d33 of 132pC/N and electromechanical coupling factor kp of 27.8%.", "The influence of milling and subsequent annealing on nickel-ferrite phase formation was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Microstructure and magnetic properties of NiFe2O4 were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and vibration sample magnetometry (VSM). Single phase nanosized nickel-ferrite was obtained by 30h mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequent annealing at 600\u00b0C for 1h. Magnetic properties of the milled powder were extensively affected by the annealing temperature. Considerable growth of the particles and necking by sintering resulted from annealing at 1000\u00b0C.", "The (1\u2212x)(0.9405K0.5Na0.5NbO3\u20130.0095Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3\u20130.05LiSbO3)\u2013xNaTaO3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics were fabricated by conventional ceramic technique. The structure, dielectric, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics were investigated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the ceramics sintered in air at 1060\u20131140\u00b0C for 3\u20134h formed single phase pervoskite solid solutions with the tetragonal symmetry at room temperature. The microstructure of the ceramics became homogeneous with addition of NaTaO3. The orthorhombic\u2013tetragonal transition temperature (TO\u2013T) shifted to below room temperature with addition of NaTaO3. The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of ceramics were enhanced by addition of NaTaO3. The outstanding electrical properties of piezoelectric coefficient d33=249pC/N, electromechanical coupling factors, kp=0.442 and kt=0.426, relative permittivity, \u03b5 33 T / \u03b5 0 = 1604 and loss tangent, tan\u03b4=0.023 were obtained at x=0.06. The related physical mechanisms for the enhancement of dielectric and piezoelectric properties were discussed.", "Lanthanum doped W-type hexaferrites BaZn2LaxFe16\u2212xO27 (x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) were synthesized by co-precipitation and sintered at 1320\u00b0C. The X-ray diffraction reveals W-type hexagonal structure with few traces of secondary phase. The decrease in grain size as a function of La-concentration is attributed to the fact that La acts as a grain inhibitor. The saturation magnetization and remanance decrease due to spin canting on B-sites. The increase in coercivity follows 1/r behavior where r is the radius of grain. The DC resistivity was observed to increase from 0.59\u00d7107 to 8.42\u00d7107\u03a9cm with increasing La-contents due to the unavailability of Fe3+ ions. This enhancement in resistivity makes these materials promising candidates for use at high frequencies in order to reduce eddy current losses.", "The Ti-doped TiO2 (TiO2:Ti) nanoceramic films were deposited by simultaneous rf magnetron sputtering of TiO2 and dc magnetron sputtering of Ti. When dc power increased, TiO preferentially formed and the deposited films had lower O/Ti atomic ratio, especially at low substrate temperature. With the decrease of substrate temperature, the TiO2:Ti film had relatively high optical energy gap, therefore the absorption edge showed the blue shift. The nonlinear refractive indices of TiO2:Ti films prepared at different dc powers and substrate temperatures were measured by Moir\u00e9 deflectometry, and were of the order of 10\u22128cm2W\u22121. By decreasing dc power and increasing substrate temperature, TiO2:Ti film exhibited lower surface roughness, higher linear refractive index and lower stress-optical coefficient.", "Hexagonal structure magnetoplumbite ferrites have revealed a higher dispersion frequency than that of nickel ferrites because of the magnetoplumbite's magnetic anisotropy. The magnetoplumbite ferrite densification temperature always exceeds 1000\u00b0C and the initial low temperature firing permeability of magnetoplumbite ferrites with added glass is too low (\u03bci=2\u20134). Therefore, it is desirable to develop a material that has a higher permeability at above 300MHz and can be densified at temperatures below 900\u00b0C. The Bi2O3\u2013B2O3\u2013ZnO\u2013SiO2 (BBSZ) glass addition effects on the densification and magnetic properties of Co2Y\u2013NiCuZn ferrite composites with various Co2Y/NiCuZn ferrite ratios were investigated. The densification of Co2Y\u2013NiCuZn ferrite composites was enhanced by the addition of glass at low sintering temperatures (<900\u00b0C) due to the liquid phase sintering. Co2Y\u2013NiCuZn ferrite composites with 4wt% BBSZ glass sintered at 900\u00b0C show a relative density above 90%, a high-initial-permeability of 5\u20136, a quality factor of above 30 in the 200\u2013300MHz frequency and a resonance frequency above 1GHz, which can be used in high frequency multilayer chip inductors.", "Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3\u2013xBaTiO3 (BNT\u2013xBT) nano-powders are successfully synthesized by a modified citrate method. The as-prepared BNT-BT powders and the sintered ceramics are homogeneous with a pure perovskite crystal structure. The effects of Ba2+ substitutions for (Bi0.5Na0.5)2+ in the A-sites of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 on its phase transformations are explored. The transformations among ferroelectric (FE), anti-ferroelectric (AFE) and paraelectric (PE) states in these ceramics are characterized using ferroelectric hysteresis tests, modulated differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. The FE-AFE transition in BNT\u2013xBT with 0\u2264x\u22640.15 is found to relate with a structural transformation which is a first-order phase transition. The mechanical and thermal analyses provide evidence that AFE state (0\u2264x\u22640.15) could be associated with the incommensurate modulation of rhombohedral structures while the mechanisms of forming AFE state in BNT\u2013xBT (x>0.15) could be different.", "P-type higher manganese silicide (HMS) has attracted considerable interest due to its remarkable thermoelectric (TE) properties and potential applications at intermediate and high temperature TE devices. In this study, a series of nanostructured bulk p-type HMS materials with different compositions of MnSix (where x=1.73, 1.75 and 1.77) were synthesized via mechanical ball milling and hot-press sintering. The X-ray diffraction analysis of the synthesized materials showed that increasing the Si contents yields to a slight shift to higher diffraction angles. The increase in Si content further resulted in a decrease in electrical conductivity and increase in Seebeck coefficient. The power factor of all three compositions are approximately identical. However, the lowest thermal conductivity was achieved in MnSi1.75 and resulted in the highest figure-of-merit among all the compositions.", "The perovskite-like layered structure (PLS) A2B2O7 compound Sr2Nb2O7 was doped with donor dopants CeO2 and WO3 to explore their doping effect on its A and B site, respectively. The doped ceramics were prepared by Spark Plasma Sintering. For Ce doping on the A site, single phase was maintained up to 5mol% Ce (x=0.05 in (Sr1\u2212xCex)2Nb2O7). For W doping on the B site, single phase was maintained at 2.5mol% W (x=0.025 in Sr2(WxNb1\u2212x)2O7). The cerium and tungsten doping both inhibited grain growth and changed the grain morphology, leading to less anisotropic grains. The Curie point Tc was obtained by measuring the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and it was found to reduce for both Ce and W doped SNO. The W doped ceramics showed a diffuse ferroelectric phase transition at the Curie point. The DC resistivity of tungsten and cerium doped SNO increased compared to undoped SNO at temperatures below 700\u00b0C. These results showed that both Ce and W had a strong influence on the dielectric and electrical properties of the Sr2Nb2O7 ceramics.", "Highly transparent Dy-codoped lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) ceramics were sintered from oxide powders by the hot pressing method. The ceramics exhibited a transparency as high as 67% at 632.8nm (close to the theoretical value). The effects of substituting Lanthanum by Dysprosium on the phase structure, microstructure, dielectric, ferroelectric, optical and electro-optic properties of PLZT were examined. The results showed that Dy substitution decreased the coercive field, improved the optical transmittance and electro-optic properties of PLZT ceramics. Moreover, the high half-wave voltage (affecting the working voltage of devices) of PLZT was reduced from 850V to 510V by Dy substitution. Modified PLDZT transparent ceramics are competitive candidate materials for modern optical communication, and the variable optical attenuator (VOA) based on PLDZT exhibited excellent performances.", "Nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide thin films were deposited using a new approach, which involves the sputtering of a sintered TiN target in a reactive DC magnetron discharge running in O2/Ar mixtures. Based on the higher chemical affinity of titanium for oxygen compared to nitrogen, samples with N concentrations ranging between 1.1 and 9.3 at% were conveniently prepared by adjusting the gas composition in the deposition chamber. Surface characterization of the prepared thin films was done by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and contact angle measurements, while film crystallinity was checked with an X-ray diffraction. The current results show how the dopant content can be controlled by adjusting the oxygen intake in the films during reactive discharge deposition. The XPS spectra clearly show that nitrogen\u2013titanium bonds are formed. Nitrogen doping induces broadening of the valence band, and, consequently, narrowing of TiO2 band gap. Additionally, doping affects the surface morphology, as demonstrated by atomic force microscopy and contact angle data. The effect of carbon contaminant removal under UV irradiation on the hydrophilic conversion process is discussed.", "Single phase CoFe2O4 powders were prepared by solution combustion synthesis using \u03b2-alanine as fuel. By adding to the reaction mixture various amounts of oxalic acid, which act as a retarding agent and pore generator, properties of CoFe2O4 powders can be properly adjusted. Depending on the amount of oxalic acid, the average crystallite size of CoFe2O4 ranges between 13 and 41nm, whilst the specific surface area varies between 1.8 and 34.4m2/g. The combustion synthesized CoFe2O4 powders exhibit a hard ferimagnetic behavior. The CoFe2O4 coercivity varies between 71.8 and 126.0kA/m and the saturation magnetization ranges between 53.0 and 70.6emu/g. After uniaxial pressing and sintering at 1400\u00b0C for 4h, the pellets reached relative densities up to 90% of the CoFe2O4 theoretical density.", "Barium hexaferrite (BHF) was obtained by high energy ball milling using milling power of 4:1 and 10:1 and milling times of 1h and 10h, hereinafter referred to as BHF411, BHF4110, BHF101 and BHF1010, respectively. After sintering at 1200\u00b0C, the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The magnetic and dielectric properties were examined using a permeameter (8.4kOe) and an impedance analyzer (300MHz\u20131.1GHz), respectively. The properties of coercivity and magnetic saturation of the BHF41 samples increased with milling time, but decreased over time for BHF101. At low frequencies, both BHF41 samples showed a slight variation in relative permittivity (\u03b5\u05f3), but this property remained almost constant at high frequencies. On the other hand, the initial permittivity of BHF101 samples varied significantly at low frequencies, but was almost constant at high frequencies. All the BHF samples showed a decreasing behavior of tan\u03b4 at the highest frequencies.", "Tin-doped gallium oxide (Ga2O3:Sn) films with different Sn contents were deposited on MgAl2O4 (100) substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique. Structural analysis revealed that the films with 1% to 5% Sn were polycrystalline structure of \u03b2-Ga2O3 whereas the samples containing 8\u201312% Sn were microcrystalline. The resistivity of the film could be reduced by almost eleven orders of magnitude by Sn doping, the 10% Sn doped sample possessing the best conducting property with resistivity of about 3.1\u00d710\u22122\u03a9cm. The average transmittance for the 10% Sn doped sample exceeded 80% with a band gap of about 4.14eV.", "In this study, we investigated the effects of substituting Mn3+ for some Fe3+ in spinel lattice on the structure, magnetic properties, magnetostriction behavior, and AC impedance characteristics of cobalt ferrites. The manganese substituted cobalt ferrites (Co\u2013Mn ferrites), CoMnxFe2\u2212xO4, with x varied from 0 to 0.3 in 0.1 increments, were prepared by solid-state reaction. XRD examination confirmed that all sintered Co-based ferrites had a single-phase spinel structure. The average grain size, obtained from SEM micrographs, increased from 8.2\u03bcm to 12.5\u03bcm as the Mn content (x) increased from 0 to 0.3. Both the Curie temperature and coercivity of Co-based ferrites decreased with greater amounts of Mn, while the maximum magnetization (at H=6kOe) of Mn-substituted cobalt ferrites was larger than that of the pure Co-ferrite. Magnetostrictive properties revealed that the pure Co-ferrite had the largest saturation magnetostriction (\u03bbS), about \u2212167ppm, and the CoMn0.2Fe1.8O4 sample exhibited the highest strain sensitivity (|d\u03bb\u22a5/dH|m) of 2.23\u00d710\u22129A\u22121m among all as-prepared Co-based ferrites. In addition, AC impedance spectra analysis revealed that the real part (Z\u2032) of the complex impedance of Co\u2013Mn ferrites was lower than that of pure Co-ferrite in the low frequency region, and the Co-based ferrites exhibited semiconductor-like behavior.", "Bi0.5(Na0.82K0.18)0.5TiO3 (BNKT) thick films were prepared by screen-printing on the alumina substrate. Grain growth behavior, constrained sintering processing, dielectric properties, ferroelectric properties and piezoelectric properties were studied. The results show that BNKT thick films exhibit a much lower grain growth rate and smaller grain size than bulk samples due to the constrained sintering on rigid substrates. The XRD measurement revealed that the residual tensile stress formed during sintering resulting from the constrained in-plane shrinking. The typical 80\u03bcm thick films demonstrate the relative dielectric constant of 775, dielectric loss of 3.6% at 1kHz, remnant polarization of 18.6\u03bcC/cm2, coercive field of 61kV/cm, and longitudinal effective piezoelectric coefficient, d33 of 105pm/V at room temperature. Compared with BNT-based piezoelectric bulk ceramics, the smaller longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient is related to the clamping effect of the substrate and the limited extrinsic piezoelectric contributions due to the reduced non-180\u00b0 domain wall motions.", "In this paper, we report the fabrication and systematic characterization of Fe Doped ZnO thin Films. FexZn1\u2212x O (x=0<0.05) films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering on Si (400) substrate. Influence of Fe doping on structural, optical and magnetic properties has been studied. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that Fe doping has affected the crystalline structure, grain size and strain in the thin films. The best crystalline structure is obtained for 3% Fe Doping as observed from Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The magnetic properties studied using Vibrating Sample Magnetometer reveals the room temperature ferromagnetic nature of the thin films. However, changing the Fe concentration degrades the magnetic property in turn. The mechanism behind the above results has been discussed minutely in this paper.", "The Al2O3-modified Pb0.99(Zr0.95Ti0.05)0.98Nb0.02O3 (PZT 95/5) ferroelectric ceramics with enhanced breakdown strength were prepared from PZT 95/5 powders coated with a thin Al2O3 shell layer, which were fabricated by a Citrate-Chelation method followed by a conventional sintering process. The microstructure and electrical properties of the as-prepared ceramics as a function of Al2O3 content were systematically investigated. The results reveal that Al2O3 nanoparticles are successfully coated on PZT 95/5 powders to form the core\u2013shell structure and well dispersed at the grain boundaries of the PZT 95/5 ceramic matrix after sintering, which strengthened the grain boundaries. In particular, compared with pure PZT 95/5 ferroelectric ceramics, PZT 95/5 ceramics with less than 1.0wt% Al2O3 inclusion possess the enhanced breakdown strength and energy density, of which the largest increment being 25.9% and 13.5%, respectively. It is indicated that the as-prepared PZT 95/5 ferroelectric ceramics may be a promising candidate for explosively driven power supply.", "Ti thin films were grown by DC sputtering on a glass substrate and then nitrided in a hot cathode arc discharge plasma system, which is an effective approach to independently monitoring the plasma and nitriding parameters. The hardness of pristine Ti thin film is found to be ~3.06GPa, which increases upto ~16.08GPa with an increase in negative bias voltage to \u2212140V and then decreases to ~15.05GPa for higher of \u2212240V bias voltage. Similar kind of variation has been observed in crystallite size and surface roughness. Crystallite size is found to increase from 11.1nm (pristine Ti) to 14.8nm (for \u2212140V) and then reduces to 11.9nm for \u2013240V. Surface roughness increases from 2.78nm (pristine) to 6.84nm (for \u2013140V), which is found to be 4.14nm for \u2013240V. Optical and electrical measurements also reveal the strong impact of negative bias voltage on the bandgap and resistivity of the films. Above results are understood on the basis of diffusion of nitrogen ions for lower voltages and saturation of nitrogen ions in the host lattice for high voltages.", "Two samples of the ferromagnetic alloy \u2013 ferroelectric ceramics nanocomposite (FeCoZr)x(PbZrTiO3)(100\u2212x) of similar metallic phase contents have been produced using ion-beam sputtering in the atmosphere of argon and oxygen. The samples have been produced in order to examine the influence of sputtering atmosphere parameters on electrical properties of the tested materials. In a nanocomposite of a reduced oxygen content, a conductivity increase by about three orders occurs along with the increasing frequency, which is associated with the occurrence of hopping recharging. Over the whole area of low measuring frequencies, negative values of the phase shift and a capacitive type of conductivity occur. For the frequency of about 106Hz, the phase shift reaches zero, which corresponds to the voltage resonance phenomenon. For higher frequencies, positive phase shift values and inductive conductivity occur. For a sample of a higher oxygen content, phenomena of voltage resonance (low frequency values) and current resonance (high frequency values) can be observed. When the oxygen content increases, frequency dependences of the phase difference get shifted into the low frequency area. This is associated with the surface oxidation or a complete oxidation of the metallic-phase nanograins, which increases the potential barrier as well as with an increase of the relaxation time activation energy. For the sample of a higher oxygen content, an increase of the conductivity activation energy has been observed in the low temperature area.", "Pure BT and BT doped with 1 and 2mol% Zr, with orthorhombic-tetragonal (O-T) phase transitions near room temperature were prepared, with different grain sizes, by conventional ceramic method, at various sintering temperatures. Intrinsic and extrinsic effects of Zr addition on structural, dielectric, piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of BT ceramics, near O-T phase transition were studied. In coarse grained ceramics, the intrinsic effects manifested in low field measurements (dielectric and piezoelectric constants), were reduced by Zr addition, while the extrinsic effects which control the high field response (remanent polarization and coercive field) were significantly enhanced. Instead, in fine grains ceramics, of either pure or doped BT, the extrinsic effects related to increased domain wall and grain boundaries density were dominant in both low and high field measurements, overlapping Zr effects. The results were explained in terms of crystal anisotropy correlated with grain size effects.", "(Mg0.95Zn0.05)2(Ti0.8Sn0.2)O4 powder was synthesized by a solid state reaction. Then, Ni0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 was grown on the (Mg0.95Zn0.05)(Ti0.8Sn0.2)O4 particles in a hydrothermal environment to form a core-shell structure. (1-x)(Mg0.95Zn0.05)2(Ti0.8Sn0.2)O4@xNi0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 composite ceramics were sintered at 1200\u00b0C with these powders. XRD, SEM, TEM analyses indicated that high dense core-shell ceramics without any foreign phase were obtained. Different types of sharp interfaces were self-assembled owing to the minimization of direct elastic energy in the hydrothermal environment. The composites enjoy good magnetic and dielectric properties, especially, good microwave dielectric properties with high saturation magnetization when the ferrite content is 0.3\u20130.5. The results provided a powerful experimental basis for the sensor and transducer.", "Oriented barium hexaferrite films grown on wide band-gap semiconductor substrates (such as SiC) are promising candidates for high-power microwave integrated devices. In this work, BaFe12O19 (BaM) films with c-axis randomly distributed in the film plane were prepared by direct current magnetron sputtering on a-plane 6H-SiC substrates. An insight into the orientation relationship and the epitaxial-like growth mechanism demonstrates that ( 11 2 \u00af 0 ) planes of BaM have been grown on ( 11 2 \u00af 0 ) 6H-SiC substrates. The random alignment of [0001] axis within the film plane was revealed by X-ray diffractions, X-ray pole figures, polarized Raman spectra and magnetic hysteresis loops. The BaM films on 6H-SiC substrates exhibited a large remanence ratio, Mr/Ms, of about 0.64 along in-plane axis and a relatively small one of ~0.2 for the out-of-plane hard axis, showing the potential of application in self-biased microwave devises.", "Fabrication of highly conductive and transparent TiO2/Ag/TiO2 (referred hereafter as TAT) multilayer films with nitrogen implantation is reported. In the present work, TAT films were fabricated with a total thickness of 100nm by sputtering on glass substrates at room temperature. The as-deposited films were implanted with 40keV N ions for different fluences (1\u00d71014, 5\u00d71014, 1\u00d71015, 5\u00d71015 and 1\u00d71016ions/cm2). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of N+ implantation on the optical and electrical properties of TAT multilayer films. X-ray diffraction of TAT films shows an amorphous TiO2 film with a crystalline peak assigned to Ag (111) diffraction plane. The surface morphology studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) revealed smooth and uniform top layer of the sandwich structure. The surface roughness of pristine film was 1.7nm which increases to 2.34nm on implantation for 1\u00d71014ions/cm2 fluence. Beyond this fluence, the roughness decreases. The oxide/metal/oxide structure exhibits an average transmittance ~80% for pristine and ~70% for the implanted film at fluence of 1\u00d71016ions/cm2 in the visible region. The electrical resistivity of the pristine sample was obtained as 2.04\u00d710\u22124\u03a9cm which is minimized to 9.62\u00d710\u22125\u03a9cm at highest fluence. Sheet resistance of TAT films decreased from 20.4 to 9.62\u03a9/\u25a1 with an increase in fluence. Electrical and optical parameters such as carrier concentration, carrier mobility, absorption coefficient, band gap, refractive index and extinction coefficient have been calculated for the pristine and implanted films to assess the performance of films. The TAT multilayer film with fluence of 1\u00d71016ions/cm2 showed maximum Haacke figure of merit (FOM) of 5.7\u00d710\u22123\u03a9\u22121. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of N 1s and Ti 2p spectra revealed that substitutional implantation of nitrogen into the TiO2 lattice added new electronic states just above the valence band which is responsible for the narrowing of band gap resulting in the enhancement in electrical conductivity. This study reports that fabrication of multilayer transparent conducting electrode with nitrogen implantation that exhibits superior electrical and optical properties and hence can be an alternative to indium tin oxide (ITO) for futuristic TCE applications in optoelectronic devices.", "Di-phase multiferroic composite ceramics of 0.9BaTiO3-0.1Ba(1-x)SrxFe12O19 have been successfully prepared using microwave hydrothermal and microwave sintering methods. The mobility is decreased resulting in increased resistivity due to the crystal structure becomes more compact (Sr2+ ionic radius is smaller than Ba2+) after doping Sr2+. The study of dielectric exhibits the tan\u03b4 decreasing and \u03b5\u2032 increasing after doping Sr2+. To further study the two relaxation peaks, the activation energy is calculated which originate in the Debye-like relaxation and hopping of electrons between Fe2+/Fe3+, respectively. The P-E loops show slimmer loops as a result of reduced the dielectric loss and conductive leakage loss owing to higher resistivity obtained after doping Sr2+. All the magnetic hysteresis loops present a waisted shape which is attributed to the change of grain size and existence of non-magnetic phase BaTiO3. In summary, the nearly invariable ferromagnetism but enhanced dielectric and ferroelectric properties multiferroic composite ceramics are obtained by doping Sr2+. In addition, the sample of x = 0.6 has the best-integrated performance among all the contents.", "We fabricated CuO/Al2O3 green compacts from plate-like Al2O3 and granular CuO powders by multi-press forming and investigated the alumina orientation using Lotgering's method. The results showed that Al2O3 particles preferentially aligned perpendicular to the pressure direction and the orientation degree increased as the forming pressure was increased. We proposed a model describing the movement of the alumina particles to explain the pressure effect on their orientation. The orientation calculation was in good agreement with those by Lotgering's method. Furthermore, we prepared the CuAlO2 compacts by regular or spark plasma sintering (SPS). However, the compacts sintered by SPS exhibited higher orientation degree and density than those produced by regular sintering. The electrical conductivity values of the orientation-controlled compacts sintered by SPS reached 770Sm\u22121 at 928K, which was close to that of CuAlO2 single crystal. The power factor of the CuAlO2 compacts with highest orientation degree is as high as 5.95 \u00d7 10\u22125Wm\u22121K\u22121 at 928K. Therefore, we can conclude that orientation control is an effective method to enhance the thermoelectric performance of compact polycrystalline CuAlO2 bulks.", "In this investigation, pure and gadolinium-doped cobalt ferrites (Co1\u2212xGdxFe2O4+\u03b4, x= 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08y 0.1), were synthesized through a modified route of the coprecipitation method. X-ray diffraction technique shows a cubic phase of the spinel-type structure typically associated with these compounds. According to Scherrer's equation, the crystallite size can be tuned through the Gd3+ content (26nm to x= 0 and 9nm to x= 0.1) or through the temperature of the thermal treatment (21nm to 400\u00b0C and 28nm to 700\u00b0C). The obtained powders show a ferrimagnetic behavior, at room temperature, with magnetization (reached at the maximum applied field) and coercivity values showing a dependence on the substitution grade of cobalt (II) by gadolinium (III) ions. At x= 0.02 the magnetization shows an increase of 7% (even when the particle size decreases a 40%) and the coercivity shows a decrease of 45%. DC conductivity of sintered ferrites is enhanced up to 3 orders of magnitude in the x= 0.1 substituted materials; while, keeping a constant transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect around 0.35%.", "Small-sized Ca2.8-xBixDy0.2Co4O9+\u03b4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.1) powders with a plate-like morphology were synthesized via the citric acid-assisted sol-gel method. The structural and thermoelectric properties of Ca2.8-xBixDy0.2Co4O9 samples were studied with an emphasis placed on the Bi content and the fabrication process. The as-sintered Ca2.8-xBixDy0.2Co4O9 samples exhibited a single Ca3Co4O9+\u03b4 phase and a plate-like morphology. With increased Bi content, the grain size of the sintered Ca2.8-xBixDy0.2Co4O9 samples decreased, whereas the density of the sintered Ca2.8-xBixDy0.2Co4O9 samples increased. The incorporation of Bi up to x = 0.075 yielded high electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the Seebeck coefficient decreased with increases in Bi content. The largest power factor (2.18 \u00d7 10\u22124Wm\u22121K\u22122 at 800\u00b0C) was obtained for the twice-sintered Ca2.725Bi0.075Dy0.2Co4O9. The partial substitution of Bi for Ca and the twice sintering were a highly effective route for improving the thermoelectric properties of Ca2.8Dy0.2Co4O9.", "In this paper, we have reported the signature of multiferroicity and pyroelectricity in BaFe12O19 hexaferrite close to room temperature. The BaFe12O19 hexaferrite samples are synthesized by co-precipitation method at different sintering temperature ranging from 800 to 1200\u00b0C and study their structural, ferroelectric, magnetic, magnetoelectric and pyroelectric properties. X-ray Diffraction patterns show the pure phase formation for all samples. Morphological changes are examined through the scanning electron microscope. The maximum ferroelectric polarization (0.66\u03bcC/cm2) is observed for the sample sintered at 1200\u00b0C, however maximum magnetic polarization 74emu/g is observed for sample sintered at 1000\u00b0C.

Furthermore, maximum pyroelectric constant (147 \u00d7 10\u221213C/cm2\u00b0C) is observed at 75\u00b0C for BaFe12O19 samples sintered at 1200\u00b0C. The observation of both multiferroicity and pyroelectricity close to room temperature in BaFe12O19 hexaferrite is interesting and useful for multifunctional devices.", "Pure BiFeO3 (BFO) and Al doped BFO samples were synthesized via citrate precursor method and sintered at 500\u00b0C for two hours. Effect of Al doping on the structural, optical, electrical, dielectric and magnetic properties were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the distorted rhombohedral structure without any merging of peaks which indicates no structural transformation. Average crystallite size was found to be in the range 28\u201339nm. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images illustrated the dense, agglomerated, spherically shaped with reduced grain size nanoparticles. Increased value of dielectric constant with low dielectric tangent loss was observed for the Al doped BFO samples. The value of dielectric constant was found to be 51 at 100kHz for x = 0.1 sample. Temperature dependent dielectric constant showed a dielectric anomaly, indicating the antiferromagnetic transition. The remanent polarization and the corresponding coercive field for x = 0.1 was found to be 0.0625\u00b5C/cm2 and 56.154kV/cm at an operating voltage of 1000V. The improved electrical properties with low leakage current density were ascribed to the stabilization of the pervoskite structure and reduced oxygen vacancies.", "Fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) are the main precursors of environmentally ubiquitous perfluorinated acids, and determination of FTOHs at low concentrations presents significant challenges. In this study, a new liquid chromatography\u2013electrospray mass spectrometry (LC\u2013ESI-MS) method in conjunction with low-energy collision dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) was developed by employing an optimized derivatization reaction with dansyl chloride (DNS) in acetonitrile under catalysis of 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine (DMAP). The instrument detection limits (IDLs) of the newly developed method were 0.014, 0.015, 0.014, 0.0075 and 0.0093\u03bcg/L for 4:2 FTOH, 6:2 FTOH, 8:2 FTOH, 10:1 FTOH and 10:2 FTOH respectively, which were 7.5\u2013241 times lower than those without derivatizaiton and 57\u2013357 times lower than previous GC/MS method. The method was successfully applied to analyze FTOHs in sediments combined with WAX and silica cartridges cleanup. The overall method recoveries were from 67\u00b16.0% to 83\u00b19.4% with matrix effects of 15%. The limits of quantification for all FTOHs were 0.017\u20130.060ng/gdry weight (dw).

The developed method provides a new method to sensitively determine FTOHs in environmental matrices.", "The current trend towards integration in the telecommunication field leads us to study the magnetic layers. Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B films on Mo and Si(100) substrates, of the form of Mo/Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B, Si(100)/Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B, Si(100)/Ti/Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B and Si/Ti/Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B/Ti were prepared by magnetron sputtering. The effect of deposition parameters on the structure and the magnetic properties of the films has been studied. The hard Nd2Fe14B phase is formed by a postannealing treatment under argon only on the Si/Ti/NdFeB/Ti multilayers. The Ti underlayer prevents Fe\u2013Si reactions and the Ti overlayer avoids Nd oxidation. No special crystallographic anisotropy is detected. The coercitive fields are about 480kA/m. The presence of Nd2Fe14B phase is proved by low temperature magnetic measurements.", "A facile technique was developed to modify boron nitride (BN) nanosheets with iron oxides in order to fabricate highly-oriented polysiloxane/BN nanosheet composite films and their thermal properties were evaluated according to the orientation of BN. The surfaces of the BN nanosheets were modified with iron oxide nano particles by chemical vapor deposition, and their one-dimensional arrangement with variation of BN content was controlled under a magnetic field. The homogeneous suspension of BN nanosheets and pre-polymers of polysiloxane was cast on a glass spacer, and subjected to a magnetic field before the mixture was crosslinked. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device measurements were employed to identify the phases and amounts of iron oxide nano particles deposited on the BN nanosheets. The results revealed that the modified BN nanosheets were aligned either horizontally or vertically to the film plane, depending on the direction of magnetic flux with high anisotropy. The transmittance and thermal conductivity of the nano composite films were improved due to the orientation of the BN nanosheets inside the polymer matrix.", "Diamond-like carbon (DLC) is a promising protective coating for future optical storage technologies. The requirements place conflicting constraints on the nature of the DLC. It must be transparent at 400 nm, hard and wear-resistant, uniform, pinhole-free, have a low stress and be deposited at high rate without a high heat load on a plastic substrate. In order to optimise the films under these constraints, we have studied in detail the band gap, stress, density and Young's modulus of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition using a large area electron cyclotron wave resonance source of 14 in. diameter and a variety of hydrocarbon gas sources. We have been able to produce wear-resistant carbon coatings with a high transparency at 400 nm without damaging the plastic disks. We also show that for these films the refractive index can be used as a rapid empirical means of property correlation.", "How the layer thickness influences the atomic scale bonding structure and the light emission of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) was addressed in our investigations. For this purpose a-C:H films of different thicknesses (60\u20132249 nm) were prepared from benzene by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition method. Photoluminescence (PL) investigations performed in a broad emission and excitation energy region exhibit a considerable change of luminescence with layer thickness. The photon energy of maximal efficiency shifts into the lower energy region. The optical band gap decreases also as the layer thickness increases. Raman spectra were measured by 785 nm excitation. A considerable broadening of the G band region parallel with its shift to smaller wavenumbers with increasing layer thickness was generally observed. Luminescence properties will be discussed in the framework of structural changes monitored by the Raman scattering investigations.", "Amorphous carbon with different structures was used as antireflective coating on crystalline silicon solar cells. Polymeric-like carbon (PLC) and diamond-like carbon (DLC) were deposited by the PECVD technique on the anode and cathode electrode, respectively. Tetrahedral-like carbon (ta-C) was deposited by the filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA). An increase in the short circuit current comparable to that obtained by conventional antireflective coating (SnO2) was obtained using PLC antireflective coating. The effect on the short circuit current of the other structures (DLC and ta-C) is reduced mainly due to the band gap and/or a mismatch on the index of refraction of the film and the crystalline silicon substrate.", "We investigated the film structure and the electrical properties of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) thin films. a-C:H thin films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering. Two different RF power sources of 13.56MHz and 60MHz were used to deposit the a-C:H films. The bonding hydrogen concentration varied from 1.6\u00d71022cm\u22123 to 8.6\u00d71022cm\u22123. The concentration of incorporated hydrogen atoms varied from 18 to 57at.%. The optical gap increased from 1.58eV to 2.56eV with increasing the hydrogen concentration. The resistivity increased from 1013\u03a9cm to 1015\u03a9cm with increasing the hydrogen concentration. The permittivity measured at 1MHz decreased from 5.6 to 2.3 with increasing the hydrogen concentration. These results suggest that the film structure and electrical properties can be controlled by the hydrogen concentration.", "A series of CVD diamond films have been exposed to hydrogen plasma in the linear magnetized plasma device, MAGPIE, with various applied sample stage biases between 0V (no applied bias) to \u2212500V. The plasma-induced damage to the surface structure of the diamond films has been investigated by Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy in both the Auger electron yield (AEY) and total fluorescence yield (TFY) modes. The key diamond NEXAFS spectral features (diamond core exciton and second absolute band gap) are found to be diminished following plasma exposure as measured in the surface sensitive, AEY spectra, whilst these features remain unchanged relative to an unexposed diamond reference film as measured using the bulk sensitive, TFY spectra. These results, in conjunction with SRIM simulations, show definitively that the damage to the surface of the diamond films is restricted to the scale of the penetration depth of the H ions and no damage is induced at greater depths. The power and sensitivity of NEXAFS spectroscopy in assessing damage to the surface of diamond from fusion-relevant plasma-surface interactions are demonstrated.", "A technique to coat hydrogen-free diamond-like carbon (DLC) films on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrates has been developed by sputtering of a negatively biased graphite target in a mixture of argon and nitrogen plasma. The coated films were characterized by various methods to investigate their chemical, electronic features, and particularly their biomedical properties. DLC films produced by this method have up to 20% sp3 carbon bonds depending on the nitrogen concentration in the plasma. Raman spectroscopy revealed that, bond-disorder increases with nitrogen doping. The average grain size of DLC decreases in the nitrogen doped samples by almost 30%. The roughness of the uncoated PTFE substrate surfaces decreased dramatically from 660nm to 170nm after DLC coating. However, the nitrogen contents in the plasma have little effects on the roughness, the cluster size, and shapes. Electronic band gap of the samples decreases with adding nitrogen from ~2eV in nitrogen-free samples to ~1eV in nitrogenated samples. Lower adhesion and aggregation of platelets on PTFE surfaces coated with DLC-10% nitrogen and DLC-20% nitrogen have been observed while there is greater adhesion of platelets on DLC-30% nitrogen and DLC-40% nitrogen.", "Quantum dot materials, in which Si QDs are embedded in a dielectric matrix, offer the potential to tune the effective band gap, through quantum confinement, and allow fabrication of optimised tandem solar cell devices in one growth run in a thin film process. Such cells can be fabricated by sputtering of thin layers of silicon rich oxide sandwiched between a stoichiometric oxide that on annealing crystallise to form Si QDs of uniform and controllable size. For approx. 2nm diameter QDs these result in an effective band gap of 1.8eV. Introduction of phosphorous or boron during the growth of the multilayers results in doping and a rectifying junction, which demonstrates photovoltaic behaviour with an open-circuit voltage of almost 500mV. However, the doping behaviour of P and B in these QD materials is not well understood. In addition P and B have large but opposite effects on QD crystallisation, with P (B) doped material forming larger (smaller) QDs than for undoped material. Alternative materials for quantum dots are Ge and Sn. These allow lower processing temperatures to be used, more compatible with underlying layers. Alternative matrices to SiO2 such as SiNx or SiC offer higher tunnelling probability and hence lower resistance. These alternative matrix materials can also be used as hetero interlayers to improve the transport in the growth direction whilst maintaining quantum confinement. Group IV alloys can also be used to modify band gap. GeC in particular looks to have useful band gap and sputtering properties. Such alloy materials could be used in hetero-junction or homojunction devices in combination with SiQD based materials to fabricate all thin film tandem cells.", "The emitter of silicon heterojunction solar cells consists of very thin hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers deposited at low temperature. The high sheet resistance of this type of emitter requires a transparent conductive oxide layer, which also acts as an effective antireflection coating. The deposition of this front electrode, typically by Sputtering, involves a relatively high energy ion bombardment at the surface that could degrade the emitter quality. The work function of the transparent conductive oxide layer could also significantly modify the band structure at the emitter. In this work, we study the particular case of p-type crystalline silicon substrates with a stack of n-doped and intrinsic amorphous silicon layers deposited by Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition. The front electrode was an indium-tin-oxide layer deposited by Sputtering. The Quasi-Steady- State Photoconductance technique has been used to characterize the emitter quality by measuring the effective lifetime and the implicit open-circuit voltage. These measurements confirmed a strong degradation of the heterojunction after depositing the indium-tin-oxide layer. However, it is also shown that the initial degradation could be completely recovered by an adequate thermal treatment. In this sense, annealing times from 10 to 90minutes at temperatures ranging from 100 to 160\u00b0C have been studied, both in vacuum and inside an oven.", "This work reported a sol-gel preparation method for the SiO2 coated KS-6 composite anode material by using KS-6 graphite, silicon oxide, and glucose (C6H12O6). Silicon oxide was used as a surface modification dopant and C6H12O6 was used as a carbon source. The composite anode material was sintered at 600-700oC in an Ar atmosphere for 5h. The characteristic properties of the composite anode materials were examined by micro-Raman spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, EA and AC impedance method.

It was found that the specific discharge capacities of 16wt.%SiO2 coated KS-6 composite anode materials were 404, 422. 323, 192, 67, 29 and 13 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5 and 10C rate, respectively. However, they all showed the current efficiency of ca. 96-99%. Apparently, the as-synthesized SiO2 coated KS-6 composite anode can be a good candidate for high power Li-ion battery applications.", "Silicon multilayer thin films with stack of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) of varied hydrogen dilution were prepared by hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD). The optical properties of the thin films were measured by UV-visible spectroscopy. The smooth transmittance spectra measured in the range of 500-1100nm show films with uniform deposition. The optical constants such as refractive index, absorption coefficient, tauc band gap, extinction coefficient together with thickness were determined using envelope method. It is found that the optical band gap decreases from 1.78eV to 1.6eV as hydrogen dilution increases.", "This study investigates the microwave electromagnetic shielding properties of secondary use composite materials used as ingredients in shielding materials.

These materials were tested in a powder form in bulk conditions. The investigation also included core-shell type spheres \u2013 expanded polystyrene (EPS) coated by MS (MS@EPS), diameter 4.0\u20135.0 mm and coating thickness 150 \u03bcm. A setup of radiofrequency generating and metering instruments were utilized to measure the reflective and transmission properties of the innovative material. The radiofrequency field tests were done at 2.4 GHz frequency (WiFi network frequency). Reflection and transmission characteristics of the material were measured by free space method. Reflection and transmission coefficients (from 0 to 1) were calculated to each tested sample. The measurements results show full transmission properties for CR and MS@EPS. In case of LECA 91% of the radiation passed through the material while 15% of reflection was measured.

The cleavage and recombination of S\u2013S bonds formed during discharge and charge process are the key components for the capacity. The cathode performance of three organosulfur materials, i.e. 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMcT), poly-2,2\u2032dithiodianiline (PDTDA) and a conductive sulfur-containing material (CMS) were characterized here. Among them, DMcT compounded with polyaniline (PAn) can provide a relatively flat discharge potential at about 1.4V vs. Mg/Mg2+. PDTDA exhibits better kinetics and electrical conductivity based on the intramolecular electrocatalytic effect of the aniline moiety on thiolate anions. CMS compounded with PAn produces stable backbones to provide electrically conducting channels and higher disulfide bond content; it exhibits nearly 120mAh/g initial discharge capacity and good capacity retention. We expect that further improvements to the capacity and cyclability will make organosulfur compounds potential cathode materials for magnesium batteries.", "A potentiometric organic gas sensor-based on BiCuVO x (Bi2Cu0.1V0.9O5.35) solid electrolyte was investigated. Electromotive force (EMF) of the sensor device, in which a BiCuVO x sintered disk is fitted with composite electrodes of BiCuVO x /La0.6Sr0.4Co0.78Ni0.02Fe0.2O3, was measured in the presence of various organic gases at 350\u2013500\u00b0C. The device responded to volatile organic compounds (VOC) of formaldehyde, toluene, and ethanol, but showed little sensitivities to methane, propane, propene, CO, and H2. The EMF of the sensor was linear to the logarithm of organic gas concentrations, suggesting that the generation of EMF is explained on the basis of the mixed potential theory. The observed good sensitivity toward VOC derives from the good oxide ion conductivity of BiCuVO x and proper electro-catalytic activity of the perovskite oxide electrode even at lower temperature.", "The layered LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 was synthesized by wet-chemical method and characterized by X-ray diffraction and SQUID magnetometry. The powders adopted the \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure. The ferromagnetism observed below Tc=140K is attributed to the linear Ni2+(3a)\u2013O\u2013Mn4+(3b)\u2013O\u2013Ni2+(3a) magnetic paths, from which we derive that 7% of the nickel occupies the (3a) Wyckoff position in place of Li, constituting a Ni2+(3a) defect. The analysis of the magnetic properties in the paramagnetic phase in the framework of the Curie\u2013Weiss law agrees well with the combination of Ni2+ (S =1) and Mn4+ (S =3/2) spin-only values. Results of structural and magnetic properties of chemically delithiated sample are consistent with the electronic state Mn4+/Ni4+ and the high-spin configuration for Ni4+ ions. The LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 electrode sintered at 900\u00b0C delivers a capacity 166mAh/g at 0.1C rate which is capacity retention of 95%.", "Cathode Li[Li0.2Ni0.17Co0.16Mn0.47]O2 was prepared by solid-state reaction on various sintering process. It is shown that all the samples are homogeneous with smooth crystals from XRD patterns and SEM images. The particle size of the materials grows bigger with the increase of the sintering temperature. The charge\u2013discharge tests demonstrated that the initial capacity of the compound increases with increasing in calcining temperature and decreasing in calcining time. The sample synthesized by a secondary sintering process has good crystallity, and excellent electrochemical performance. It delivered the largest initial discharge capacity (195.1mAhg\u22121) and reached the highest value of 214mAhg\u22121 at the 8th cycle, and still retain 179.5mAhg\u22121 after 40 cycles.", "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films as block layers are prepared by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TEM-(SAED) analyses of the films reveal that they are polycrystalline in nature and have tetragonal structure with preferred orientation along the (101) direction. The surface morphological studies by FESEM and AFM reveal the uniform surface coverage of the grains on the surface of the films. An optical transmittance value of 80% in the visible light region with the optical band gap value of 3.2eV is measured. This sputtered TiO2 thin film is used as a blocking layer over which a thick layer of TiO2 of about 10\u03bcm was prepared using TiO2 paste and this stack is used as the photoanode of a DSSC cell. Electron beam evaporated platinum thin film on FTO coated glass substrate is used as counter electrode. The performance of the cell with a Voc of 0.698V, a Jsc of 6.8 mAcm\u22122 and an efficiency of 4.2% was achieved", "Nano-sized hollow spindle LiMnPO4 with a well-developed olivine-type structure was synthesized with the assistance of glucose in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/H2O under ambient pressure and 108\u00b0C. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show that the LiMnPO4 particles consist of hollow spindles with a mean width of 200nm, length of 500-700nm, and wall thickness of about 30-60nm. The LiMnPO4/C nanocomposite was obtained by sintering nano-sized LiMnPO4 with glucose at 650\u00b0C under an inert atmosphere for 4h. With a coated carbon thickness of about 10 nm, the obtained composite maintained the morphology and size of the hollow spindle. The electrochemical tests show the specific capacity of LiMnPO4/C nanocomposite is 161.8mAhg\u22121 at 0.05C, 137.7mAhg\u22121 at 0.1C and 110.8mAhg\u22121 at 0.2C. The retention of discharge capacity maintains 92% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. After different rate cycles the high capacity of the LiMnPO4/C nanocomposite can be recovered. This high performance is attributed to the composite material's hollow spindle structure, which facilitates the electrolyte infiltration, resulting in an increased solid-liquid interface. The carbon layer covering the hollow spindle also contributes to the high performance of the LiMnPO4/C material as the carbon layer improves its electronic conductivity and the nano-scaled wall thickness decreases the paths of Li deintercalation.", "Thin film positive electrodes of lithium-rich manganese oxide spinels were prepared by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering from a LiMn2O4 ceramic target at a total pressure close to 2Pa. Post-annealing treatments were necessary to get well-crystallized thin films displaying interesting electrochemical performances. Raman spectrum exhibiting several well-defined bands between 296 and 635cm\u22121 is typical for the lithium-rich spinel. Based on ICP, RBS and XRD analyses, the thin films composition is close to Li1.2Mn1.8O4. The latter is also in accordance with a Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio close to 0.1 deduced from XPS measurements. Best electrochemical performance (capacity value, cycling life) between 2V and 3.5V vs Li+/Li was obtained for thin films annealed at 600\u00b0C. A volumetric capacity of 52\u03bcAhcm\u22122 \u03bcm\u22121 (close to about 90% of the theoretical value) was obtained at the first cycle at a C/100 regime. Contrary to most studies carried out on spinel thin films cycled in the 3V range, no appreciable degradation of the discharge capacity was observed after few tens of cycles at room temperature, highlighting the beneficial effect of substituting 20% of Mn ions by Li ions and the presence of microvoids in thin films that limits the effect of strain generated from volume variation during the Li insertion/deinsertion process.", "In this paper, I present the photocatalytic hydrogen production by using transition metal ions-doped \u03b3-Bi2O3 which is an oxide semiconductor having the band gap of 2.8 eV.\u03b3-Bi2O3 semiconductor was doped with various transition metal ions, Cr(VI), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Ru(III), Pd(II), etc., by the high-temperature sintering method and characterized by DRS, IR, SEM, TEM, XPS, and EPR. Photocatalytic hydrogen production was carried out by using methyl viologen as the electron relay by using xenon arc lamp as the light source. The photocatalytic hydrogen-production efficiency of the doped \u03b3-Bi2O3 with the different dopants is found to be in the decreasing order: Pd(II)Ru(III)Co(II)Ni(II)Fe(III)Cr(IV)undoped \u03b3-Bi2O3. Two factors seem to be responsible for the effect of transition metal ions ex. Schottky type of barrier and metal ions behave as microcathodes.", "An AB 5 - type hydrogen storage alloy, LaNi 4.25 Al 0.15 Co 0.5 V 0.1 , was mixed with Ag flakes or Ni powder, pressed, and sintered to fabricate a durable pellet that would maintain its integrity during repeated gas phase or electrochemical hydriding and dehydriding. The molar compositions Ag / AB 5 \u2a7e 10 and Ni / AB 5 \u2a7e 25 could meet this requirement. After sintering, the alloy in the pellet Ag / AB 5 = 10 maintains the original phases, but a second phase appears in the pellet Ni / AB 5 = 25 . The volume expansions of these two pellets after hydrogenation are 5\u20138%. The number and size of microholes in the pellet Ni / AB 5 = 25 are larger than those in the pellet Ag / AB 5 = 10 , presumably due to different shapes of Ni powder and Ag flakes. The difference in the shape of the metallic binders also affects the discharge capacity. It is concluded that by careful control of the mixing ratio and sintering condition, the electrodes will have a potential application for charging in the gas phase and discharging in electrolyte.", "In this study, amorphous antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) coatings on Cr coated stainless steel and multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) buckypaper substrates were prepared using a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering process as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries. The MWCNT anode, amorphous SnO2:Sb anode and amorphous SnO2:Sb-MWCNT nanocomposite anode have shown first discharge capacities of 446 mA h g\u22121, 1064 mA h g\u22121 and 1462 mA h g\u22121, respectively.

The microstructural and thermoelectric properties of Ca0.9La0.1\u2212x Bi x MnO3\u2212\u03b4 were studied, with respect to the partial substitution of Bi3+ for La3+. All of the sintered Ca0.9La0.1\u2212x Bi x MnO3\u2212\u03b4 crystallized in the orthorhombic perovskite structure, belonging to the Pnma space group. The substituted Bi3+ significantly increased grain size and density because it acted as a sintering additive. The electrical conductivities of tape casting-processed Ca0.9La0.1\u2212x Bi x MnO3\u2212\u03b4 were much higher than those of cold compaction-processed Ca0.9La0.1\u2212x Bi x MnO3\u2212\u03b4. On the other hand, the absolute values of the Seebeck coefficient for tape casting-processed Ca0.9La0.1\u2212x Bi x MnO3\u2212\u03b4 were similar to those of cold compaction-processed Ca0.9La0.1\u2212x Bi x MnO3\u2212\u03b4. Consequently, tape casting-processed Ca0.9La0.1\u2212x Bi x MnO3\u2212\u03b4 showed a much higher power factor in comparison with cold compaction-processed Ca0.9La0.1\u2212x Bi x MnO3\u2212\u03b4. The partial substitution of La3+ by Bi3+ up to x = 0.05 led to an increase in the power factor. The highest power factor (3.01 \u00d7 10\u22124 Wm\u22121\u00b7K\u22122) was obtained for tape casting-processed Ca0.9La0.05Bi0.05MnO3\u2212\u03b4 at 800 \u00b0C.", "Aluminum\u2013nitrogen (Al\u2013N) codoped zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were grown on glass substrate by radio frequency (RF) reactive magnetron sputtering using aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO, 2.5wt% Al2O3) target and N2 as reactive gas. The structural, morphology, optical and electrical properties were also investigated with different flow rate of N2 gas. X-ray diffraction results shows that codoped ZnO thin films have similar wurtzite structure like undoped ZnO film. Al\u2013N thin films have high transparency 78% in visible region as the nitrogen flow rate increases the transparency and band gap decreases. The best p-type codoped sample shows a resistivity and hole concentration of 0.554\u03a9cm and 8.3\u00d71019 cm\u22123 at room temperature, respectively. Current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) characteristics of p-type codoped ZnO thin films are also discussed.", "In the present work, we have deposited calcium doped zinc oxide thin films by magnetron sputtering technique based nanocrystalline particles elaborated by sol-gel method. In the first step, the nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel method using supercritical drying in ethyl alcohol. The structural studied by X-ray diffractometry indicates that CZO has a polycrystalline hexagonal wurzite structure with a grain size of about 30nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements have shown that very small particles of CZO are present in the aerogel powder. In the second step, calcium-doped zinc oxide (CZO) films were deposited onto glass substrates by rfmagnetron sputtering at ambient temperature using. The effects of calcium on structural, electrical, morphological and optical properties were investigated. It is found that all the thin films have a preferential c-axis orientation. With increase of Ca doping, the peak position of the (0 0 2) plane is shifted to the high 2\u03b8 values. A minimum resistivity of 5.10\u22123 \u03a9cm is obtained for the film doped with 3% Ca. The films are highly transparent in the visible wavelength region with a transmittance higher than 85% and optical band gap ranging from 3.30 to 3.42eV.", "Varied p-type doping structure has been verified to be efficient to improve the QE of III\u2013V semiconductor photocathode because of the built-in electric field, and the gradient-doping structure is also efficient for GaN photocathode. Here we study the band structure of the exponential-doping GaN photocathode and get the QE formula. Based on the formula, the parameters influencing the QE are analyzed. Due to the limitation of MOCVD method, it is hard to obtain exponential-doping structure GaN photocathode. Here ALD method is proposed to grow exponential-doping GaN material, TMG, NH3, and Cp2Mg are chosen as the Ga, N, and Mg precursor source, respectively. Growth temperature is fixed at the range of 450\u2013550\u00b0C, and within this temperature range crystal structure GaN material can be obtained. Finally, to get the exponential-doping structure, the relationship of Ga and Mg cycle is studied, and the formula is given.", "The lead free perovskite ferroelectric nano-powder (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 (x\u202f=\u202f0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1) have been synthesized by using Sol-gel method. The main issue of measurement the UV-optical properties of the ceramics can be shortened into the solubility of the powder inside a suitable solution. The present study reports an overview for how to solve this problem and the technique has been illustrated in-details in the experimental section. The crystalline and the microstructure of the investigated samples were observed employing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) analyzer respectively. The thermal analysis of the pure calcined powder was performed by using differential thermal analysis (DTA). The single phase powder and ceramics were detected by using XRD, where the phase obtained by calcined and sintered the samples at 1000 and 1200\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh respectively. The patterns were observed matched with BaTiO3 perovskite tetragonal structure with absence of any detectable for the secondary phases. The particle size of the ceramics was observed decreased with increasing the concentration of Sr ions owing to the different ionic radius between Ba2+ (1.36\u202f\u00c5) and Sr2+ (1.19\u202f\u00c5). The characterization of the electrical properties for the sintered pellets within the temperature range (30\u2013270\u202f\u00b0C) were performed by dielectric spectroscopy method. The temperature and frequency dependences of dielectric permittivity (\u0511r) and diffused phase transition (DPT) showed the changes in the character of the ferroelectric-paraelectric (FE\u2013PE) phase transition.", "We have used direct current radio frequency (DC/RF) sputtering to deposit cobalt- incorporated zinc oxide (Co:ZnO) thin films on glass substrate. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied for structural observation while topography was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The optical studies were carried out by UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy. The elemental composition was performed via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The chemical state studies were also investigated. The shifting of XRD pattern towards higher diffraction angle confirmed successful incorporation. The optical observation showed \u201cd\u2013d\u201d electron transition during the thin film deposition. The photocatalytic response was carried through the degradation of methylene blue (MB). The improved photocatalytic behavior of Co:ZnO thin films were attributed to the high binding energy component (HBEC) of oxygen vacancies. We have also proposed the tentative mechanism of cobalt incorporation into ZnO through XPS finding. We also checked the stability of deposited thin films. Co:ZnO thin films are new attractive candidates for degradation of waste dyes.", "Amorphous thin films with composition of Ge61.44Te31.39In7.17 were prepared by magnetron co-sputtering method on chemically cleaned glass substrates. The effect of thermal treatment on structure and optical properties had been investigated. As-deposited and annealed thin films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Visible/near-infrared transmission spectroscopy and Raman spectra. XRD and SEM results show that an amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition occurs after annealing and the crystalline degree increases with increasing annealing temperature, which in turn, lead to the change in the optical constant. According to the classic Tauc equation, it can be found that the optical band gap of the thin films rises with increasing annealing temperature up to 150\u00b0C and then drastically decreases with temperature beyond 200\u00b0C. This behavior is interpreted on the basis of the change in the structure of the thin films, from amorphous to crystalline state, with increasing the annealing temperature. Raman spectra studies reveal that the formation of c-GeTe is mainly responsible for the macroscopic phase transition during the crystallization process.", "In-doped GeSe2 films were prepared by magnetron co-sputtering method. Amorphous behavior of as-deposited films was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction. The linear optical properties of the films have been derived by analyzing transmission spectra. The experimental results show that linear refractive index rises and optical band gap reduces from 2.04eV to 1.66eV with increasing In content. The proper In content of 13.18 at.% is obtained by optimizing the composition of the films. The nonlinear optical properties of the films were studied at 800nm by using femto-second Z-scan measurement. Experimental results show that the third-order nonlinear refractive index and nonlinear susceptibility of In13.18(GeSe2)86.82 film are up to 8.50\u00d710\u221216m2/W and 1.41\u00d710\u22129esu, respectively, almost two orders larger than those of the GeSe2 film. These excellent properties indicate that In-doped GeSe2 films are perspective in the aspect of all-optical applications.", "Infrared transparent ceramics found to have potential applications as infrared windows and domes in strategic defence and space missions. Synthesis of ultrafine nanostructured MgAl2O4 ceramics by a modified single step auto-igniting combustion technique, followed by sintering of the sample by resistive and resistive-microwave hybrid heating to high density and their excellent infrared transmission characteristics are presented in this paper. Structural characterisations of MgAl2O4 nanoparticles reveal that the as prepared powder is phase pure, with average crystallite size \u223c15nm and possess a cubic structure. Optical band gap calculated using the Kubelka\u2013Munk method is 5.75eV. The thermal stability of the nanopowder at elevated temperatures has been studied using thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Hybrid heating yield a substantial reduction in sintering temperature and soaking time relative to the conventional resistive heating, and the samples achieved >99% density by microwave-resistive hybrid heating. Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) showed that the pellets are well sintered. The pellet sintered by hybrid heating showed a better transmittance of \u223c79% in the UV\u2013Visible region and \u223c82% in the mid IR region compared to pellet sintered by resistive heating which has \u223c68% in the UV\u2013Visible region and \u223c66% in the mid IR region. The results confirm the effective use of nanocrystalline powders from modified combustion synthesis as starting material for the development of high quality IR transparent windows and domes. In addition the microwave hybrid sintering technique employed in the present study also contributes to the results of better transmittance characteristics in highly densified MgAl2O4 ceramic pellets.", "Ternary sulfide AgBi3S5 compound is expected to be a promising thermoelectric material because of its merits such as low electrical resistivity and environmentally compatible composition. In this study, a combined process of mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering was applied to the fabrication of AgBi3S5 bulk materials, and nearly single phase was obtained by optimizing the sintering conditions, although the mill-derived powders consisted of AgBiS2 and Bi2S3 phases. The electrical conductivity of the AgBi3S5 bulk material decreases from 178 to 79 Scm\u22121 with raising temperature from 323 to 573 K, while the Seebeck coefficient ranges from \u221283 to \u2212167 \u03bcV K\u22121, thereby a maximum power factor 221 \u03bcW m\u22121 K\u22122 achieved at 573 K. It is notable that AgBi3S5 has a low thermal conductivity, ranging from 0.70 to 0.64 W m\u22121 K\u22121 from room temperature to 573 K, which is the lowest value reported so far for this material. A peak thermoelectric figure of merit value of 0.20 was obtained at 573 K in the present pristine AgBi3S5 sample.", "For the purpose of multilayer chip EMI filters, the new ferroelectric\u2013ferrite composite ceramics were prepared by mixing PMZNT relaxor ferroelectric powder with composition of 0.85Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3\u20130.1Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3\u20130.05PbTiO3 and NiCuZn ferrite powder with composition of (Ni0.20Cu0.20Zn0.60)O(Fe2O3)0.97 at low sintering temperatures. A small amount of Bi2O3 was added to low sintering temperature. Consequently, the dense composite ceramics were obtained at relative low sintering temperatures, which were lower than 940\u00b0C. The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) identifications showed that the sintered ceramics retained the presence of distinct ferroelectric and ferrite phases. The sintering studies and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations revealed that the co-existed two phases affect the sintering behavior and grain growth of components. The electromagnetic properties, such as dielectric constant and initial permeability, change continuously between those of two components. Thus, the low-temperature sintered ferroelectric\u2013ferrite composite ceramics with tunable electromagnetic properties were prepared by adjusting the relative content of two components. These materials can be used for multilayer chip EMI filters with various properties.", "Uranium nitride thin films were prepared by reactive sputter deposition at temperatures between \u2212200 and +400\u00b0C. These conditions provided a large variety of microstructure. At low temperatures, nanocrystalline layers (mean crystallite size 17nm) grew with a strong preferred orientation {111} perpendicular to the substrate, with a large compressive residual stress and with a high density of structure defects (i.e. with large microstrain). At elevated temperatures, the crystallites had only a moderate preferred orientation; the residual stress was partly relaxed and the density of structure defects lower. For the first time, for an actinide material, we have investigated how the microstructure influences the formation of magnetic moments and magnetic ordering. Bulk UN is an itinerant antiferromagnet. The increasing disorder suppresses the long-range antiferromagnetism and induces a ferromagnetic component in exchange interactions, leading to a cluster glass type of ordering at low temperatures. In highly disturbed thin films (low temperature deposition), UN exhibits a weak Pauli paramagnetism.", "EuCo2Si2 intermetallic compound was synthesised and characterised by X-ray powder diffraction, electric resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. No sign of magnetic ordering could be depicted from the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, whereas two ferromagnetic-like transitions were observed in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility: at 73(1) and at 21(2)K. This magnetic behaviour could be attributed to small clusters containing divalent europium ions originating from local chemical disorder embedded in a matrix containing trivalent europium ions (effective europium valence was found to be 2.94(1)). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study indicates a surface valence transition and a dramatic change of europium valence caused by Ar+ sputtering, probably due to local disorder introduced.", "LiFePO4/C composite materials were synthesized at 700\u00b0C by an in situ solid-state reaction. The effect of the sintering time on its structure, surface morphology and electrochemical performance was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy analyses, cyclic voltammogram (CV), and galvanostatically charge\u2013discharge techniques. It was found that, all prepared materials for various sintering time show the single olivine structure. The powder morphology change is negligible with extending sintering time from 5 to 40h. Moreover, the ID/IG ratio of carbon in Raman shift remains almost invariant (\u223c0.96) with the increase of sintering time. Electrochemical tests show that the discharge capacity remains at 153mAhg\u22121 with medium-rate (0.5C), while increases from about 120 to 130mAhg\u22121 at high-rate (1C) with increasing sintering time, and the possible reasons are discussed. The LiFePO4/C composite synthesized at 700\u00b0C for 30h demonstrates a best electrochemical performance, delivering a discharge capacity of 110mAhg\u22121 (1.5C) after 50 cycles.", "Ferroelectric [Pb0.92(La1\u2212zSbz)0.08][Zr0.60Ti0.40]O3 for z=0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1 were prepared from their constituent oxides by a solid state reaction technique. The powders were calcined in the temperature range of 1000\u00b0C for 6h. Phase formation, crystal structure and lattice parameter were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The compacts were sintered at 1250\u00b0C for 2h and their dielectric, ferroelectric and conductive properties were measured. The ferroelectric behavior of the doped samples was studied from their hysteresis loop.", "Magnetically soft Co, Fe, and Fe65Co35 (wt.%) materials have been adopted to sputter onto both sides of permanent magnet ribbons with nominal composition of Pr9.5Fe80.5B10 and Pr10Fe84.12B5.88 (at.%), attempting to compare the degree of magnetic properties enhancement induced by those sputtered soft magnetic films. Experimental results verified that the magnetic enhancement due to different soft magnetic films onto both types of PrFeB ribbons followed the same sequence of Fe65Co35>Fe>Co. When \u223c185nm Fe65Co35 were sputtered onto Pr9.5Fe80.5B10 or Pr10Fe84.12B5.88 ribbons, the magnetic energy product, (BH)max, of the laminated materials enhanced by 21.5\u201322.6% in comparison with that of the original ribbons.", "The synthesis of NaxCo2O4/Ag and NaxCo2O4/Au composites was tried by mechanical milling and subsequent sintering. Ag and Au particles were added to the NaxCo2O4 powder prior to the mechanical milling. The microstructure and thermoelectric properties of the NaxCo2O4/Au composite were compared to those of the NaxCo2O4/Ag composite and the NaxCo2O4 single phase, and the effects of the Ag and Au addition on the thermoelectric performance of NaxCo2O4 were discussed. Au particles around 2\u03bcm or smaller in size, which were significantly smaller than Ag particles around 10\u03bcm in size, were dispersed in the NaxCo2O4 matrix. The Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity of NaxCo2O4 were slightly enhanced and significantly reduced by these noble metals addition, resulting in the large power factor of these composites. On the other hand, the NaxCo2O4/Au composite showed the electrical resistivity larger than that of the NaxCo2O4/Ag composite. Ag and Au addition markedly increased the thermal conductivity, and the dimensionless figure of merit of NaxCo2O4 could not be improved by these noble metals addition.", "The bulk polycrystalline samples of Mn-doped ZnO were synthesized with the nominal compositions Zn1\u2212xMnxO (x=0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25) via the standard solid state reaction route by sintering at 800\u00b0C in air and argon atmospheres. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of the as synthesized samples exhibit the presence of mainly wurtzite (hexagonal) crystal structure similar to the parent compound (ZnO) in all the samples. In addition to this, XRD results also indicate the presence of secondary phases like ZnMn2O4 and Mn3O4 in minority. The M\u2013H plots, recorded at room temperature, of the samples sintered in air reveals the presence of mainly paramagnetic behavior along with signature of weak ferromagnetic interactions. On the other hand, the M\u2013H curves of all the samples sintered in argon atmosphere shows clear hysteresis loop indicating the presence of room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) in the samples. The value of magnetization at a particular field increases as content of Mn in the samples increases. The annealing of the samples in the hydrogenated argon further enhances the magnetization and ferromagnetism, whereas the same deteriorates on annealing in oxygen atmosphere. The possible mechanisms of the observed room temperature ferromagnetism have been discussed.", "The densification, grain growth and microstructure development of Li-ferrite (Li0.50Fe2.50O4) ceramics, doped with Bi2O3 as sintering aid and Co as magnetic property modifier, were studied. The primary objective of the present study was to develop magneto-dielectric materials, with matching permeability and permittivity, as well as low magnetic and dielectric loss tangents, for miniaturization of HF (3\u201330MHz) antennas. Due to its poor densification, fully sintering of pure Li0.50Fe2.50O4 requires high temperature (1200\u00b0C). High temperature sintering resulted in undesirable high dielectric loss tangent, due to the formation of Fe2+ ions. To reduce the sintering temperature of Li0.50Fe2.50O4, Bi2O3 was selected as sintering aid because of its relatively low melting point (\u223c820\u00b0C). The densification behavior and slow grain growth rate of Li0.50Fe2.50O4 were greatly improved by the addition of Bi2O3, because a liquid phase sintering occurred during the sintering process at high temperature due to the low melting point of Bi2O3. It is found that 1% Bi2O3 is able to promote full densification of Li0.50Fe2.50O4 at a temperature of as low as 850\u00b0C. Comparatively, the effect of Co on the densification and grain growth behavior of Li0.50Fe2.50O4 ceramics is much less significant.", "The effect of LMO doping on the structure, magnetic and magnetotransport properties of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSMO)/xLaMnO3 (LMO) has been investigated. Two types of LSMO/xLMO composites, named as SLx (low temperature sintered samples) and SHx (high temperature sintered samples) samples, were prepared by different sintering temperature and solid-state reaction method. The presence of LMO at the grain boundaries increases the disordered states at the surface of the grains and therefore the magnetization and transition temperature decrease by increasing the amount of LMO doping level. Results show that the rate of decreasing of transition temperature is much more for high temperaure sintered samples. Also the resistivity of samples increases by the increase of LMO doping level. Results also show that the LMO doping has an effect on a low field magnetoresistance (LFMR). The value of LFMR increases for low doping level of 0\u2264x\u226415, for SLx samples and 0\u2264x\u226410 for SHx samples. Also LFMR decreases at high doping level. The spin dependent tunneling and scattering at the interfaces of the grain boundaries are responsible for the increase of LFMR at low doping level, while reduction of LFMR at high doping level may result from the grain boundary becoming too thick for electron tunneling.", "The addition of ruthenium in aluminum-doped zinc oxide transparent conducting thin films was deposited on polyethylene terephthalate at 20\u00b0C by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique. The structure and electrical properties of the films were investigated with respect to variation of Ru concentration. The XRD and FESEM results show that the film with 0.5wt% Ru doping has the best crystallinity and larger pyramid-like grains, therefore the resistivity reached to a lowest value of 9.1\u00d710\u22124\u03a9cm. The low carrier mobilities of the films (3\u20137.2cm2V\u22121s\u22121), however, were limited by ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary scattering mechanisms since the carrier concentrations were ranged from 2.2\u00d71020 to 9.5\u00d71020cm\u22123. The transmittance in the visible is greater than 80% with the optical band gap in the order of 3.352\u20133.391eV.", "Chromium doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Cr) films have been deposited onto sapphire substrates by RF magnetron sputtering. The effects of different chromium concentrations (5, 15 and 30mol%) on structural, morphological and magnetic properties have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), respectively. According to X-ray diffraction the films are preferentially oriented along (002) diffraction plane and maintain its wurtzite structure by the addition of Cr even for higher concentration. The FWHM is found to increase initially and it saturates for 15 and 30% of Cr concentration. AFM images reveal that the surface roughness of the films is exponentially decreased upon the addition of Cr.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement confirmed that the synthesized SFN\u2013PT ceramics are of pure perovskite structure. With the increase of the concentration of PbTiO3 (PT), crystal structure of the sintered SFN\u2013PT ceramics changes from rhombohedral phase to tetragonal phase. Dielectric response of the SFN\u2013PT ceramics changes from diffused and broad dielectric peaks to relatively sharp ones accompanied by the increase of the temperature of dielectric maximum (Tm). Small content of MnO2 or Li2CO3 doping can greatly decrease the dielectric loss of the SFN\u2013PT ceramics, furthermore, the abnormal increase of dielectric constant and loss tangent in the paraelectric phase is suppressed accordingly. Typical P-E hysteresis loops are observed in the SFN\u2013PT ceramics, however, the saturate polarization (Ps) is small. MnO2 or Li2CO3 doping can greatly decrease the coercive field (Ec) of the SFN\u2013PT ceramics accompanied by large increase of Ps. Piezoelectric constant d33 of the SFN\u2013PT ceramics is small except for SFN30\u2013PT70 ceramics, which reaches 22pC/N.", "Mixed MgNi ferrites with composition Mg0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 where the mole fraction for Ni (x=0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.5 and 1) were prepared by following co-precipitation method at temperature 110\u00b0C and maintaining a pH of solution equal to 9.5 enable to achieve large particle surface area. The resultant materials obtained in powder form were sintered at different temperatures. Thermogravimetry (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy, technique were applied to obtain structural parameters. The XRD patterns reveal the presence of (311) peak as the most intense one. The intensity of XRD peak increases with increase in sintering temperature. The saturation magnetization values showed increasing trend with increase in sintering temperature from 2.37 to 29.76emu/g. These results along with the analysis of SEM micrographs are interpreted in terms of increase in particle grain size with increase in sintering temperature.", "Lead-free piezoelectric ceramics Cu-doped (1\u2212 x)(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3-xMgTiO3 (KNN-MT) were fabricated by a conventional sintering technique.

The microstructure shows some \u201cstick-like\u201d compounds in the ceramics, which is a useful additive for the KNN sintering. With Cu doping, the mechanical quality factor (Q m) of the KNN-MT ceramics is improved considerably; when x =0.05, the Q m reaches 1204. Similar to Cu-doped pure KNN, the Cu-doped KNN-MT at x =0.05 exhibits double hysteresis loops due to the effect of defect dipoles.", "Di-phase magnetoelectric composites formed by magnetic CoFe2O4 and ferroelectric Nb\u2013Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 were prepared by citrate\u2013nitrate combustion method technique by using Nb\u2013Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 template powders prepared by mixed oxides. Pure di-phase powder composites with a good crystallinity were obtained after the calcination step. The purity was maintained by sintering at temperature of 1100\u00b0C/2h, which ensured limited reactions at interfaces, while by sintering at 1250\u00b0C/2h, small amounts of secondary phases resulted. The method allowed to produce di-phase ceramics with homogeneous microstructures and a very good mixing of the two phases.

The prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TG and granularity analysis and their electrochemical performance was also investigated in this work. The results showed that the Li4Ti5O12/C composite had a spinel crystal structure and the particle size of the powder was uniformly distributed with an average particle size of 480nm. The conductive carbon was embedded in the Li4Ti5O12 particles without incorporation in the Li4Ti5O12 crystal lattice during the sintering process. The added Super-P-Li carbon played an important role in improving the electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance of the Li4Ti5O12/C electrode. Compared with raw Li4Ti5O12, the Li4Ti5O12/C composite exhibited higher rate capability and excellent reversibility.

X-ray powder diffraction study shows that bismuth evaporation and titanium excess result in the formation of the secondary nonperovskite phase and the deterioration of the sintering ability. The excessive bismuth and titanium cause the peak dielectric constant (Km) decrease and the temperature of the peak dielectric constant (Tm) shifts to lower temperature in the BCT-NBT systems. The appropriate bismuth oxide as a sintering aid leading to liquid phase sintering causes ceramics densification, increases the room temperature dielectric constant (K) and the remnant polarization (Pr) of BCT-NBT ceramics, and decreases the dielectric loss tangent (tan\u03b4) and the coercive field (Ec) of the BCT-NBT ceramics. However, the excessive titanium causes a slight improvement of tan\u03b4 and Ec. These results indicate that this chemical modification is necessary to synthesize BCT-NBT ceramics with better electrical properties in order to realize its practical applications.", "Lead-free piezoelectric ceramics 0.92(K0.48Na0.54)NbO3\u20130.08LiNbO3 have been prepared by low-temperature sintering using excess Na2O additives.

With the increasing x, the ordered L10 FePt grains form. All of the films are ferromagnetic, and the easy axis is in the film plane. With the decrease of t, the films turn from hard ferromagnetic to soft ferromagnetic. The maximum coercivity of the 100-nm thick Fe1\u2212xPtx-C granular films measured at a 10-kOe field is 3.7kOe at x=0.48. The coercivity of the Fe0.56Pt0.44-C granular films increases, and the magnetization measured at a 10-kOe field decreases with the increasing t. The reversal mechanism of the 100-nm thick Fe1\u2212xPtx-C granular films turns from the domain wall motion to the Stoner\u2013Wohlfarth rotation mode as x increases. However, the reversal mechanism of the Fe56Pt44-C granular films with different t approaches the Stoner\u2013Wohlfarth rotation mode, and is film-thickness independent.", "(Ca1\u2212xSrx)3Co4O9 polycrystalline samples (x=0, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.005, 0.006, 0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1) have been prepared by solid state reaction and sintered by spark plasma sintering. Their thermoelectric properties at high temperature have been studied (650\u20131000K). The substitution limit is close to 20%. For higher Sr contents, a pseudo one-dimensional phase of the type Sr6Co5O15 is appearing. The substitution of calcium by strontium does not significantly affect the Seebeck coefficient. Concerning electrical conductivity and power factor an optimum value exists for 0.5% substitution. Finally ZT values of samples with less than 20% Sr content are increased due to lower thermal conductivities. The dimensionless figure of merit ZT reaches 0.22 at 1000K for the composition (Ca0.995Sr0.005)3Co4O9.", "The present study was focused to investigate the effect of Co concentration on structural and, magnetic properties of Co\u2013SiO2 nanocomposite thin films. Co\u2013SiO2 nanocomposite films with different cobalt atomic concentration up to 49at% were synthesized using direct current (DC) and radiofrequency (RF) magnetron co-sputtering. TEM and XRD analyses reveal the formation of both FCC (111) and HCP (101) phases in all the samples. The particle size and surface roughness of these films is found to increase with increase in cobalt concentration. Magnetic measurements reveal that the embedded cobalt nanoparticles behave as superparamagnets when their size is \u226416nm.

The results showed that the addition of Bi and Zn can significantly promote Z phase formation. The Z phase may be triggered to decompose into U and W phases resulting from the evaporation of Bi and segregation of Co-rich ferrites at high sintering temperatures for samples with large amounts of Bi and Zn. The initial permeability decreased with increasing x value because the Bi substitution promoted Z phase decomposition into U and W phases.", "Thin films of FeCoHfN were fabricated by co-sputtering technique with the deposition angles varied. Their dynamic magnetic properties were characterized and discussed in conjunction with an analysis based on Landau\u2013Lifshitz\u2013Gilbert equation. High ferromagnetic resonance frequency beyond 6GHz was achieved by adjusting the deposition angle.

The structural, optical and magnetic properties of the films were investigated. The results from both the X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectra reveal that Eu3+ ions successfully substitute for Zn2+ ions in the ZnO lattice. The magnetic field and temperature dependence of magnetization curves demonstrate that the Zn0.95Eu0.05O films are ferromagnetic at room temperature. No impurity phase was found in Eu-doped films with X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and zero-field-cooled measurements. The ferromagnetism is attributed to the intrinsic property of Eu-doped ZnO films and could be interpreted by the bound-magnetic-polaron model.", "Mg/Fe oxide nanotubes decorated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNx) were fabricated by catalytic chemical vapor deposition of ethylenediamine on the outer surface of oxide nanotubes. Mg/Fe oxide nanotubes were prepared using a 3:1 molar precursor solution of Mg(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3 and anodic aluminum oxide as the substrate. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The XRD pattern shows that the oxide nanotubes are made up of MgO and Fe2O3.

XPS results show the nitrogen-doped level in CNx is about 7.3at.%. Magnetic measurements with VSM demonstrate the saturated magnetization, remanence and coercivity of oxide nanotubes are obvious improved after being decorated with CNx.", "An approach is used to improve the remanent polarization of BiFeO3 thin films, where the BiFe0.96Zn0.04O3 thin film with (111) orientation was grown on the SrRuO3/SrTiO3(111) substrate by rf sputtering. A higher dielectric constant and a lower dielectric loss are demonstrated for the BiFe0.96Zn0.04O3 thin film as compared with those of pure BiFeO3 thin film. The introduction of Zn deteriorates the magnetic properties of BFO thin films. A giant polarization value of 2Pr\u223c268.5\u03bcC/cm2 is induced for the BiFe0.96Zn0.04O3 thin film as confirmed by PUND, owing to the (111) orientation, the introduction of Zn, and a low leakage current density.", "Amorphous powder of BiFeO3 (BFO) was synthesized at low-temperature (80\u00b0C) by co-precipitation method. Optimal synthesis conditions for phase pure BFO were obtained. Powders were calcined in the temperature range from 400 to 600\u00b0C for 1h. Iso-statically pressed powder was sintered at 500\u00b0C for 2h. Differential scanning calorimetric thermo-gram guided for phase transition, crystallization and melting temperatures. X-ray diffraction confirmed the amorphous nature of as synthesized powder and phase formation of calcined powders. Calcination at temperature \u2265400\u00b0C resulted in nano crystalline powders with perovskite structure. Average crystallite size increased with the increase in calcination temperature. Scanning electron microscopic studies revealed dense granular microstructure of the sintered samples. The sintered samples exhibited high dc resistivity at room temperature which decreased with the increase in temperature. Dielectric constant, dielectric loss tangent and ac conductivity measurements were carried out in the frequency range (10Hz to 2MHz).

As the sintering temperature increases from 1200\u00b0C to 1250\u00b0C and 1300\u00b0C, the average grain size increases from 0.62\u03bcm to 2.82\u03bcm and 3.20\u03bcm respectively. Moreover, the domains with \u201cwater-mark\u201d and \u201clamellar\u201d features are observed in SEM micrographs. The dielectric measurements as a function of temperature show a decrease in Curie temperature on increasing the sintering temperature. The decrease in Curie temperature is attributed to the decreased tolerance factor of the perovskite ABO3 structure. There is enormous increase in the permittivity with the increase in grain size. The coercive field decreases and the remanent polarization increases as the grain size increases.", "The polycrystalline TiO2@TiC0.5\u2212xO0.5+x ceramics with core-shell structure were prepared through the spark plasma sintering process. Both thermoelectric (TE) transport properties and microstructure of the ceramics were investigated. The TiO2 shell had a remarkable effect on the transport properties of the system.

A magnet with a density higher than 99% was successfully obtained by sintering a Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B powder compact at 970\u00b0C for 20h. The average grain size of the magnet was 5.5\u03bcm, which was similar to that of the initial powder size (5\u03bcm). Compared with a conventionally sintered specimen (1070\u00b0C/4h), the coercivity of the magnet increased from 1672kA/m to 1823kA/m upon low temperature sintering. Consequently, the low temperature sintering process enabled us to suppress grain growth and to distribute the grains more uniformly, which resulted in improved magnetic properties, in particular improved intrinsic coercivity. The grain-size reduction through the low temperature sintering was explained by analyzing microstructures in relation to sintering behavior.", "Single phase Bi0.7La0.3FeO3 ceramic samples were successfully synthesized by sol\u2013gel combustion and co-precipitation methods, performing a final sintering at 820\u2013870\u00b0C from 10 up to 180min. Rietveld refinements of the XRD data detected small satellite peaks that were successfully indexed by an incommensurated modulated structure model. Lanthanum doping improves magnetic response, reduces the leakage current and dielectric losses. The piezoelectric coefficient was reported for the first time in the Bi0.7La0.3FeO3 composition.", "The deep ultraviolet detecting property of AlxZn1\u2212xO (AZO) alloy thin film as photocathode layer was investigated. This AZO thin film was deposited via RF magnetron sputtering using a ceramic target, in which the concentration of Al was about 30at%. UV/dark contrast nearly three orders of magnitude has been achieved by using it in a simply fabricated photodetector, under 254nm UV illumination with power of 0.5mW/cm2 and bias of 80V. The photocurrent can be generated even without external electric field after illumination and come to saturation when the bias reaches 80V. Conventional UV emission peak around 380nm in photoluminescence spectra of ZnO is absent in the AZO thin film. Optical band gap of the AZO thin film is estimated to be 4.41eV and corresponding cutoff wavelength is 281nm. Negative surface potential of this thin film that enables high emitting efficiency is detected using Kelvin probe microscope, due to the elimination of surface barrier.", "Thin films of (Ba0.5,Sr0.5)TiO3 (BST5) were deposited at ambient temperature on fused silica substrates by RF magnetron sputtering technique. Nano-crystalline films were obtained upon quasi-rapid thermal annealing (Q-RTA) at temperatures \u2a7e800\u00b0C for 60s. The influence of Q-RTA temperature on the structural, morphological, optical and microwave dielectric properties of BST5 thin films have been investigated. The as-deposited and Q-RTA films annealed up to 700\u00b0C were amorphous in nature. On increasing the Q-RTA temperature to 800\u00b0C and above resulted in an amorphous\u2013crystalline phase transition in the films. All the crystalline films show similar full width at half maxima (FWHM) and hence, similar crystallite size of about 12\u00b11nm. The amorphous\u2013crystalline transition was accompanied by a decrease in the optical band gap from 4.5 to 3.6 and increase in the refractive index from 1.9 to 2.2 as well as in the microwave dielectric constant from 40 to 262. The Root Mean Square roughness (RMSroughness) as measured from AFM show an increase from 0.6nm to 5.6nm with an increase in Q-RTA temperature from 400\u00b0C to 1000\u00b0C.", "Mn-doped SiC films were deposited on Si (100) substrates by the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering technique. The effect of Mn doping on the structural, magnetic and transport properties of films was systematically investigated. The results show that the Mn-doped SiC films have a 3C-SiC crystal structure and majority of Mn atoms form the Mn4Si7 secondary phase compounds. The carrier concentration increases and resistivity decreases monotonically with the increase of Mn concentration. A crossover from semiconducting to metallic transport behavior is observed and the metal\u2013semiconductor transition temperature decreases as the Mn concentration increases. Magnetic characterizations show that all films are ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature (TC) of above 300K, and the saturated magnetization (Ms) increases monotonically with the increase of Mn concentration. The carbon-incorporated Mn4Si7 compounds can be considered the origin of the observed ferromagnetism in Mn-doped SiC films.", "A series of Ca3Co4\u2212yFeyO9 and Ca3\u2212xLaxCo4\u2212yFeyO9 ceramics was prepared by sol\u2013gel method followed by spark plasma sintering. The X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that Fe is substituted at the Co-site in rock salt Ca2CoO3 layers. The partial substitution of Fe at Co-site shows a simultaneous increase in the electrical conductivity and thermopower, which results in an increased power factor. For (La, Fe) co-doped specimens, although, the electrical conductivity is decreased but the thermopower is increased sufficiently to obtain a higher power factor. The temperature dependent electrical conductivity data represents that hole-hopping is the dominant conduction mechanism for all the pure and doped specimens above 573K. The thermal conductivity is greatly suppressed by (La, Fe) co-doping because of the increased phonon scattering. A larger ZT value of 0.32 at 1000K was achieved with (La, Fe) co-doping which is about 70% higher than that of pure Ca3Co4O9.", "The effect of thermal treatment on the structural, optical, and magnetic properties of Mn-doped ZnO film prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering has been investigated. Higher pre-annealing temperature (>700\u00b0C) in O2 or N2 caused the formation of a ZnMn2O4 room-temperature paramagnetic precipitate which decreased the amount of substituted Mn2+ ions in ZnO matrix. Meanwhile, the amount of oxygen vacancies, especially the singly ionized oxygen vacancies, increased after N2/H2 annealing obtained by the analysis of photoluminescence spectrum. So based on the bound magnetic polaron model, we emphasized that the effective doping density of Mn2+ ions together with the singly ionized oxygen vacancies play an important role in tuning the magnetic coupling of Mn-doped ZnO film.", "The following conditions are deposited: (a) glass/Fe40Pd40B20(Xnm)/ZnO(50nm) and (b) glass/ZnO(50nm)/Fe40Pd40B20(Ynm), where each of X and Y is 2.5nm, 5nm, 7.5nm or 10nm. The sputtering sequence and the thickness of the FePdB film were varied to investigate their effects on the low-frequency alternative-current magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7ac), maximum phase angle (\u03b8max), maximum \u03c7ac and corresponding optimal resonance frequency (fres), electrical resistivity (\u03c1), and transmission and reflection percentages. Experimental results reveal that Fe40Pd40B20(Xnm)/ZnO(50nm) is better than ZnO(50nm)/Fe40Pd40B20(Ynm) because the nanocrystallization Fe40Pd40B20 at the bottom of the material can improve its magneto nanocrystalline anisotropy and increase the crystallization of ZnO, improving its magnetic and electrical properties. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) demonstrate that the ZnO (002) peak of Fe40Pd40B20(Xnm)/ZnO(50nm) is stronger than that of ZnO(50nm)/Fe40Pd40B20(Ynm). In particular, a comparison of high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopic (HR X-TEM) observations of Fe40Pd40B20(10nm)/ZnO(50nm) and ZnO(50nm)/Fe40Pd40B20(10nm) indicates that the Fe40Pd40B20 texture induces magneto nanocrystalline anisotropy into the nanocrystalline FePdB layer of Fe40Pd40B20(10nm)/ZnO(50nm), yielding the highest \u03c7ac of around 0.79 with an fres of 10Hz and an \u03b8max of 179\u00b0. Furthermore, \u03c1 is reduced as the thickness of FePdB increases, because grain boundaries and the surface of thin films scatter electrons, causing thinner films to have greater resistance. The \u03c1 of Fe40Pd40B20(Xnm)/ZnO(50nm) is lower than that of ZnO(50nm)/Fe40Pd40B20(Ynm) because stronger ZnO crystallization and nanocrystalline FePdB improve the scattering of electrons by the surface of the films. Finally, with respect to the optical transmittance and reflectance of Fe40Pd40B20(Xnm)/ZnO(50nm) and ZnO(50nm)/Fe40Pd40B20(Ynm), as the FePdB thickness increases, the transmittance gradually decreases, because transmittance and reflectance are inversely related to film thickness, increasing reflective efficiency. The results reveal that the magnetic and photoelectric properties of glass/Fe40Pd40B20(Xnm)/ZnO(50nm) are better than those of glass/ZnO(50nm)/Fe40Pd40B20(Ynm) owing to the tightly nanocrystalline FePdB crystallization and stronger ZnO crystallization. Glass/Fe40Pd40B20(10nm)/ZnO(50nm) is particularly effective for magnetic and photoelectric applications.", "The Fe\u20136.5wt.%Si/SiO2 core\u2013shell composite powders and compacts have been prepared by simple ball milling coating and spark plasma sintering process. The microstructure, magnetic and electrical properties of the compact samples obtained at different sintering temperatures were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, vibrating sample magnetometer, and impedance analyzer. The relative densities of Fe\u20136.5wt.%Si/SiO2 composite compacts first increase with sintering temperature from 800\u00b0C to 1150\u00b0C, and then keep nearly unchanged with higher temperature, while the coercivity and electrical resistivity change in the opposite direction. The saturation magnetization fluctuates around an identical value with increasing the sintering temperature from 800\u00b0C to 1250\u00b0C. The Fe\u20136.5wt.%Si/SiO2 composite compact sintered at 1150\u00b0C displays excellent soft magnetic properties: saturation magnetization of 153.9emu/g, coercivity of 14Oe, relative permeability of 8.6\u00d7103 at 50Hz, respectively. The Fe\u20136.5wt.%Si/SiO2 core\u2013shell composite compacts clearly exhibit much higher electrical resistivity and lower core loss (1.4\u00d710\u22125\u03a9m and 18.1W/kg (P5/400)) than those of Fe\u20136.5wt.%Si compacts without core\u2013shell structures (9.6\u00d710\u22127\u03a9m and 37.9W/kg (P5/400)). The core\u2013shell structures introduced here is a good potential method to increase electrical resistivity and reduce core loss of soft magnetic materials, which can obviously improve energy conversion efficiency of electric\u2013magnetic switching device.", "A series of Co90Zr10 thin films deposited at different oblique angles from 10\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 was prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The static magnetic properties and high frequency characteristics were investigated by measuring the hysteresis loops and microwave permeability spectra. The static magnetic results revealed that Co90Zr10 thin films prepared by oblique sputtering possessed a well-defined in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. It is found that the in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy increased with the increasing oblique angle with a peak at 55\u00b0 and then dropped rapidly above this angle. This behavior was qualitatively explained to be a result of the microstructure due to self-shadowing effect. Continuous modification of the resonance frequency in the range of 1.82\u20137.13GHz has been achieved, which is essential in high frequency applications of soft magnetic thin films.", "In this paper, we report on the preparation of Sn (core)\u2013Al (shell) nanocomposite thin films by co-sputtering Sn target and Al target, and their application as anode of lithium-ion batteries. Instrumental analyses of X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscope have been used to characterize the structure and morphology. The results reveal that the thin film is composed of core\u2013shell structure with Sn nanoparticle core and Al amorphous shell. Furthermore, measurements of charge\u2013discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been employed to characterize the electrochemical performance of Sn\u2013Al film.

Meanwhile, a discharge capacity of 420mAhg\u22121 is obtained at 3000mAg\u22121. The excellent electrochemistry performance is owing to the core\u2013shell structure in which Al shell can alleviate the expansion of volume of Sn particles and restrain the aggregation of Sn particles. The results indicate that Sn\u2013Al thin film is a promising anode for lithium-ion batteries.", "Soft magnetic nanogranular CoFe-Yttrium-doped Zirconia (CoFe-YSZ) thin films were prepared by co-sputtering YSZ with different compositions of CoFe. By simply adjusting the ingredients of films, full-width at half-maximum of the imaginary permeability spectra of CoFe-YSZ films changed greatly. Based on this phenomenon, nanogranular CoFe-YSZ films with various compositions were deposited. And the characteristics of the electromagnetic noise suppression have been evaluated using an integrated coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line. A saturation magnetization (4\u03c0Ms) as high as 21 kGs, a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency above 3.5 GHz, a suitable value of 589 \u03bc\u03a9 cm, and a low coercivity of 7.39 Oe were obtained simultaneously when the volume fraction of CoFe was 0.73. The CoFe-YSZ film with x = 0.73 shows a very wide resonance peak with the full-width at half-maximum of 1 GHz. The absorption attenuation amplitude reaches to \u22128.1 dB at the resonance frequency fr = 3.5 GHz. In addition, the transmission signal attenuation decreases sharply at the resonance frequency and almost keeps constant when the frequency is lower than 1.2 GHz. It means the input transmission signal will pass through the signal line with tiny signal attenuation below its resonance frequency.", "CZTSSe thin films are considered to be future of flexible thin film solar cell. Amount of S and Se in the CZTSSe thin films controls the band gap. Therefore, control over the concentration of S/Se is very important for enhancing the efficiency. CZTS thin films were deposited on SLG substrate by sequential reactive sputtering of metal targets. The films were annealed in Se atmosphere at 550 \u00b0C for 10\u201325 min in order to obtain CZTSSe thin films. Elemental, surface morphological, optical and structural properties of CZTSSe thin films have been investigated in detail. Optical band gap energy of CZTSSe thin films were in the range of 1.1\u20131.35 eV. XRD and Raman analysis were used to analyze the structure and phase purity of CZTSSe thin films. High intense peak at 27.9\u00b0 in the XRD pattern corresponding to (112) plane was observed. High intensity of XRD peak corresponding to (112) direction revealed that the growth is oriented along (112) direction. Raman analysis also showed the presence of two peaks related to Se and S anions in CZTSSe thin films. In the Raman spectra of CZTSSe thin films; peaks corresponding to Se anions were observed at 190\u2013206 cm\u22121 and peaks corresponding to S anions were observed at 329\u2013338 cm\u22121. Elemental analysis results showed that S/Se ratio did not change much with increase in annealing time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the deposition of CZTSSe by sequential reactive sputtering of metal targets and controlled selenization.", "Monophasic and homogeneous Ni10Zr7 nanocrystalline alloy films were successfully grown at room temperature by co-sputtering in an indigenously developed three-gun DC/RF magnetron sputtering unit. The films could be produced with long-range crystallographic and chemical order in the alloy, thus overcoming the widely acknowledged inherent proclivity of the glass forming Ni\u2013Zr couple towards amorphization. Crystallinity of these alloys is a desirable feature with regard to improved efficacy in applications such as hydrogen storage, catalytic activity and nuclear reactor engineering, to name a few. Thermal stability of this crystalline phase, being vital for transition to viable applications, was investigated through systematic annealing of the alloy films at 473 K, 673 K and 923 K for various durations. While the films were stable at 473 K, the effect of annealing at 673 K was to create segregation into nanocrystalline Ni (superparamagnetic) and amorphous Ni + Zr (non-magnetic) phases. Detailed analyses of the physical and magnetic structures before and after annealing were performed through several techniques effectual in analyzing stratified configurations and the findings were all consistent with each other. Polarized neutron and X-ray reflectometry, grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to gauge phase separation at nanometer length scales. SQUID based magnetometry was used to investigate macroscopic magnetic properties. Simulated annealing performed on this system using molecular dynamic calculations corroborated well with the experimental results. This study provides a thorough understanding of the creation and thermal evolution of a crystalline Ni\u2013Zr alloy.", "CuAlO2 compacts were prepared by SPS at 1273 K for 10 min. The crystal phases of resultant compacts were strongly depended on the designed composition of starting powders: x CuO+(1\u2212x) Cu2O+(1\u2212x/2) Al2O3. Single delafossite phase CuAlO2 compacts with different density were obtained when x = 0.15, 0.20, 0.40 and 0.60, and the correspondent SPS pressure were 40 MPa, 20 MPa, 10 MPa and 5 MPa respectively. The relative density of the compacts increased with SPS pressure increasing and led to a maximum about 97.7%. Electrical conductivity, power factor and thermoelectric figure of merit of the compacts were all enhanced by increasing density, reaching 300 Sm\u22121, 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 Wm\u22121 K\u22121 and 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 K\u22121 respectively at 873 K. The features of electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of the compacts were predicted by GEM equation. The evaluated results agreed well with the experimental results.", "In this article, the authors have reported the growth and characterization of a batch of indium doped zinc oxide films to explore the controllable n-type doping in ZnO with high crystalline quality for the optoelectronic device application. The effects of indium doping on the crystalline structure, surface morphology, electrical, and optical properties have been shown. The mechanisms regarding the grain growth, the electron scattering, and the optical band gap have been investigated and discussed. The crystallite size is constrained by the competing effect between surface energy and lattice strain, and thus maintains invariable with increasing indium doping level. The coalescence of nearby crystallites leads to the growth of grains. The grain size has been found to increase with indium incorporation, suggesting that the surface diffusion rate of adatoms is enhanced by more indium. The increased Hall mobility can be explained by the reduced boundary effect, and can be also understood in the view of ion orbit radius and percolation conduction model. The band gap has been modified by the Burstein-Moss effect and the band gap renormalization effect. The band gap values of the samples with relatively higher indium doping level are dominated by the dopant-dependent band gap renormalization effect. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the material properties of indium doped ZnO films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.", "We report the results of a small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) study on the magnetic microstructure of a textured Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B-based sintered permanent magnet. By combining unpolarized and polarized SANS (SANSPOL), we demonstrate that a number of important conclusions regarding the microscopic spin structure can be made. Specifically, the applied-field dependence of the unpolarized neutron data is in agreement with the existence of long-range spin-misalignment fluctuations, i.e., deviations of the magnetization from the mean direction on a real-space length-scale up to the micron range. In addition, measurements with polarized neutrons provide evidence for the presence of coupled nanometer-scale fluctuations in the nuclear and longitudinal magnetic scattering-length density.", "Copper oxide (CuxO) thin films were prepared by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering with a Cu2O target. The sputtering power was varied from 40 W to 80 W while the working pressures (WPs) were 3\u201310 mtorr. Deposition rates, surface morphologies, carrier concentrations, carrier mobilities, optical characteristics, bandgaps and crystallinities of the deposited films were investigated. The preferential orientations of the films were Cu2O(111) and CuO(-111). A higher WP can lead to a significant increase in the Cu2O(111) phase and the size of the grain nanoclusters. A higher sputtering power can exhibit a higher hole mobility and a lower hole concentration. The average transmittances in the visible light range and optical bandgaps of the CuxO films were 33\u201350% and 2.6\u20132.7 eV. After a post annealing process at 300 \u00b0C for 1 h in air, the nanocluster size of the CuxO film prepared at the power of 80 W with WP of 5 mtorr can be increased from 40 nm to 70 nm. Meanwhile, a high mobility of 81.4 cm2/V s, a low hole concentration of 4.2 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22123, and a low density of states of 5 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22123eV\u22121 can be simultaneously obtained. Besides, a CuxO/ZnO heterojunction diode showing rectifying characteristic was fabricated to verify the semiconductor characteristic of the deposited p-type CuxO film.", "A study is made of the effect of multistage treatment on the magnetic hysteresis properties at room temperature and below of high coercive (Nd0.55Ho0.45)2.7(Fe0.8Co0.2)14B1.2 alloy including melt spinning (MS), severe plastic deformation (SPD) and heat treatment (HT). It is shown that SPD and HT of MS samples improves the rectangularity of the second quadrant part of the hysteresis loop resulting in a more than 25% increase of the maximal magnetic energy product as compared to ordinary MS processing. The observed changes in the magnetic properties of the samples are discussed and modelled within the framework of Stoner-Wohlfarth theory of magnetization reversal processes in uniaxial ferromagnets.", "Mixed valent thin films, consisting of optically absorbing metallic cations within a dielectric matrix, possess a variety of optical and electronic properties that can be tailored through variation of dopant concentration and chemistry. This work details the reactive magnetron co-deposition of mixed valent NbxMoyOz thin films, systematically doped with optically absorbing Mo5+ cations, through adjustment of the molybdenum source power. Control over the concentration the Mo5+ valence state was achieved through decreases in the oxygen partial pressure facilitated via oxygen chemisorption by the molybdenum sputter flux at power levels of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 W, while the Nb source was operated concurrently at a constant sputter power of 200 W. The resulting films, roughly 100 nm in thickness, were characterized using variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry as well as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in order to derive a process-property relationship among molybdenum source power and its effects on the refractive index, extinction coefficient, optical band gap, as influenced by the relative concentrations of Mo5+, Mo6+, and Nb5+ cations. Increases in the molybdenum source power from 0 to 100 W allow for tailorability of the refractive index, 2.29 \u2264 n550 \u2264 2.34, extinction coefficient, 0.00 \u2264 k550 \u2264 0.02, and optical band gap, 3.05\u2264Eg \u2264 3.48 eV. The co-deposition procedure used within this work affords the ability to systematically adjust the content of the absorbing Mo5+ cations, from 0 to 3 at. %, within a dielectric matrix comprised of MoO3 and Nb2O5, presenting several opportunities in increasing the design-space for both optical coatings and electrochromic devices.", "Mg-doped Cu2SnSe3 films were prepared by DC magnetron co-sputtering at room temperature for 1 h with two different targets of Cu and Sn or Cu-Mg and Sn based upon the formula of (Cu2\u2212xMgx)SnSe3 at x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, abbreviated as Mg-x-Cu2SnSe3, or the [Mg]/([Cu]+[Mg]) composition ratios in the Cu-Mg target at 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15, followed by a selenization procedure at 550 \u00b0C under the Se atmosphere. Mg-doped Cu2SnSe3 films were a cubic structure. The direct optical band gaps of Mg-x-CTSe films at x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 were estimated to be 1.19 eV, 1.18 eV, 1.19 eV, and 1.21 eV, respectively. Defect chemistry was studied by measuring structural and electrical properties of Mg-doped Cu2SnSe3 as a function of dopant concentration. Mg-x-CTSe films showed p-type at x = 0 and 0.1 and n-type at x = 0.2 and 0.3. The explanation based upon the Mg-to-Cu antisite donor defect for the change in electrical property was declared. Mg doping in controlling the electrical properties of CTSe films is fulfilled, as we did for its bulks.", "Composite materials comprised of a ceramic matrix with metal-containing nanoparticles were prepared by sintering a blend of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles and polycarbosilane. Sintering process was performed either in air or argon, resulting in different material composition. The air-sintering materials consist mainly of oxide phases (silica matrix and cobalt ferrite nanoparticles). The process of sintering in argon leads to partial reduction of oxides and formation of \u03b1-Fe, carbide and silicate phases. The prepared samples were characterized by the SEM, TEM, XRD and EMR techniques and the M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. Static magnetic properties were also studied. All samples were found to be soft magnetic. Sintering, especially in argon, increases remnant magnetization of resulting composite products.", "Mischmetal-Fe-B ribbons were prepared by melt-spinning method, and industrial mischetal with low purity was selected as the raw material. By introducing La and employing nonequilibrium technology, we successfully avoid the formation of CeFe2 phase, which decreases magnetic performance greatly. Considerable energy product and intrinsic coercivity were achieved in (MM)2.4Fe14B, which are 80.69 kJ/m3 and 500 kA/m, respectively. Phase composition and magnetization process of all the samples were investigated. Strong pinning effect was found in all rare-earth-rich samples and was identified as a crucial factor to obtain high coercivity in ribbons compared with the sintered magnets. The Henkel plot is also measured to investigate the intergrain interaction and the results show a strong exchange coupling between grains. Based on these results, the difference in magnetic performance between nanocrystalline ribbons and sintered magnets can be explained.", "We herein exploit the inherent benefits of both multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and spark plasma sintering (SPS) for augmenting the performance of rare-earth free Mn56Al44 permanent magnets through grain refinement and stabilization of \u03c4-phase. A good combination of remanent magnetization, coercivity and energy product values: 42.5 emu/g, 3.22 kOe and 1.92 MGOe; and 45.6 emu/g, 3.64 kOe and 2.26 MGOe were achieved for the SPSed Mn-Al magnets with 1.5 and 2 wt % additions of MWCNTs, respectively. The observed coercivity enhancement in the SPSed Mn-Al/MWCNT nanocomposite magnets is hypothesized to originate from the domain-wall pinning, as a consequence of precipitation of MWCNTs in the form of broken nanotubes and amorphous carbonaceous material at the grain boundaries. Although, a more detailed study is essential to verify the above fact, the present strategy provides a new basis for producing high performance rare earth free Mn-Al permanent magnets in a simpler way using the SPS process.", "The Ba0.97-xCaxLa0.03Ti0.90Sn0.10O3 (x = 0.02\u20130.10) lead-free piezoelectric ceramics were fabricated via conventional solid-state sintering process at 1480 \u00b0C. The effects of Ca2+ ions substitution on microstructure and electrical properties of the ceramics were researched. Ca2+ ions substitute for A-site Ba2+ ions to enter the unit cell maintaining the perovskite structure of th solid solution and the orthorhombic phase and tetragonal phase coexist in the composition with x = 0.04 to 0.10. SEM images confirmed the inhibiting effect of Ca ions on the grain growth process of the Ba0.97-xCaxLa0.03Ti0.90Sn0.10O3 ceramics. Uniformly distributed microstructures with high relative densities above 94.71% were developed with the further addition of Ca2+ ions. Main piezoelectric parameters were optimized at x = 0.04 with a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 541 pC/N), a planar electromechanical coupling factor (kp = 45.7%), The analysis on the temperature dependence of dielectric permittivity approved the existence of the mixed ferroelectric-relaxor features in all the BCLST samples. The remnant polarization (Pr) reaches an extreme value of 7.81 \u03bcC/cm2 at x = 0.08.", "This work reported a mechanochemically aided sintering process for the synthesis of BaFe12\u2212xAlxO19 (x = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0) hexaferrite ceramic. A brief analysis was conducted on the synthesis mechanism of the pure barium ferrite, its morphology, and magnetic properties. By substitution of Al3+ ions into BaFe12O19 lattice, the size of the grains decreased and their hexagonal-plate shape tended toward a rod-like shape. These events led to a single domain nature in the grains and also an increase in their magneto-crystalline anisotropy. Single domain nature obtained a barrier against the movement of the domain walls, which led to an increase in coercivity. On the other hand, the increase of anisotropy led to the enhancement of coercivity, according to the Stoner\u2013Wohlfarth model. The substitution of Al3+ ions also led to the decrease of the saturation magnetization, which was because of the lower magnetic moment of Al3+ ions (0 \u03bcB) compared to that of Fe3+ ions (+5 \u03bcB). As a result of substituting Al3+ ions with a value of x = 2, a maximum reflection loss of \u221243 dB was obtained at a frequency of 15.7 GHz.", "Generally speaking, the change of the composition and temperature would affect the optical properties of rare earth element doped ferroelectric materials. Besides, the factors during the preparation or post-treatment process of materials such as the stress, the external field and so forth could cause influence on the phase structure of rare earth element doped ferroelectric materials and further affect its macroscopic properties. An obvious variation of Up-conversion emission spectra was observed in Er3+ doped (Li,K,Na)NbO3 ceramics by adjusting the cooling down speed of the sintering process. X-ray diffraction analysis evidently indicated the phase structure evolution from tetragonal phase to orthorhombic with the increase of cooling down speed. Meantime, the enhanced Up-conversion emission intensity was closely related with the favored formation of the orthorhombic phase induced by the stress during the cooling down process.", "Fe-Si alloy powders were coated with ZrO2 nanopowders via mechanical milling to fabricate Fe-Si (core)/ZrO2 (shell) composite powders. The resultant composite powders were consolidated to magnetic powder cores by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The effects of sintering temperature on microstructure, resistivity and magnetic properties were investigated along with the densification process of the composite compacts. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that the surfaces of the composite powders were coated with a layer of ZrO2 powders after mechanical milling. Moreover, the polished surface of the sintered composite compacts displayed a micro-morphology of core-shell structure with core of Fe-Si alloy particles and shell of ZrO2 layers indicating that the electric Fe-Si alloy particles were well insulated by the intergranular ZrO2 layers. The Fe-Si/ZrO2 magnetic powder cores with 7.5 wt.% ZrO2 sintered at 825 \u00b0C exhibited excellent magnetic properties: 1.43 T for saturation magnetic induction, 220 for maximum permeability and 25.48 Oe for coercivity. The core-shell structured powder cores possessed much higher resistivity and lower core loss (688 \u03bc\u03a9 cm and 147 W/kg) than those of the raw Fe-Si powder cores (94 \u03bc\u03a9 cm and 471 W/kg). Overall, the preparation process of magnetic powder cores by SPS provides a promising method to reduce core loss and improve magnetic properties of soft magnetic composite materials.", "In this study, we investigated the structural and electrical properties of TiO2/Ta2O5 stacks prepared using DC reactive magnetron co-sputtering for as-deposited films and films annealed at 700 \u00b0C. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the as-deposited films were amorphous, whereas those annealed at 700 \u00b0C were polycrystalline with mixed phases of TiO2 and \u03b2-phase Ta2O5. The presence of mixed phases of TiO2 and \u03b2-phase Ta2O5 was also confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The optical band gap of the TiO2 films was 3.46 eV for the as-deposited films and decreased to 3.35 eV with increasing Ta2O5 layer thickness on TiO2. The films annealed at 700 \u00b0C showed a decrease in band gap to 3.32 eV for TiO2, and this value further decreased to 3.15 eV with increasing Ta2O5 layer thickness on TiO2. Furthermore, we investigated the electrical properties of the sputtered TiO2/Ta2O5 stacks fabricated on a metal\u2013insulator\u2013semiconductor (MIS) Al/Ta2O5/TiO2/p-Si Schottky diode. We studied the variation of the fundamental Schottky barrier characteristics (ideality factor, Schottky barrier, and series resistance) for a diode prepared using reactive magnetron sputtering with TiO2/Ta2O5 as a thin insulating layer at the Al/p-type Si interface with different thicknesses at both room temperature and 700 \u00b0C. Improved electrical characteristics were observed for the annealed Al/Ta2O5/TiO2/p-Si MIS Schottky structure compared with those of the as-deposited structure.", "We report on a systematic study of the electronic, magnetic properties and topological Hall effect (THE) in the hexagonal MnNiGa alloy films as a function of Mn contents. It was found that the MnNiGa alloy films with pure hexagonal structure and flat surface could be obtained on oxidized Si(001) substrates through magnetron sputtering. An analysis of magnetic and transport properties reveals that MnNiGa alloy films show a magnetic structure transformed from ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic structure with increasing Mn contents, accompanied by a maximum of the saturation magnetization near the stoichiometric composition. We have further investigated the stability of the large THE emerging in MnNiGa alloy films with various Mn contents over a wide temperature-magnetic field region. In contrast to bulk MnNiGa alloy, a reversion of the sign of THE was clearly observed in Mn-rich MnNiGa alloy film, indicating the THE of MnNiGa alloy can be manually controlled by varying Mn contents.", "Cu2SnS3 (copper tin sulfide, CTS) is regarded as a promising eco-friendly TE material due to its phonon-glass-electron-crystal nature. In our work, ceramics of p-type pristine and Ni-doped Cu2SnS3 bulk materials were prepared by solid-state reaction and spark plasma sintering process. Ni-doping effectively optimized the electrical transport performance, with a very high PF about 0.9 mWm\u22121K\u22122 due to the unique electron-crystal advantages of CTS. Induced by Ni-substitution, the crystal structure of CTS transformed from original monoclinic to cubic symmetry with a softening of M-S bonds and a disordered metal atom arrangement which gave rise to a reduction of sound velocity and a strongly intensified phonon scattering. Low lattice thermal conductivity, ranging from 0.95 Wm\u22121K\u22121 near 300 K to 0.41 Wm\u22121K\u22121 at 723 K, was achieved, with the latter approaching the theoretical minimum. As a result, a relatively high ZT up to 0.56 was obtained at 723 K in the Cu2Sn0.9Ni0.1S3 sample.", "FexSe superconducting bulks with different norminal Fe content from x = 1.00 to 1.20 have been fabricated with high-energy ball milling (HEBM) aided sintering process. The influences of original Fe contents on the phase composition, microstructures and superconducting properties were systematically investigated. It was noticed that with the increase of original Fe content, the nonsuperconducting \u03b4-FeSe phase content decreased, while the content of residual Fe increased correspondingly. Meanwhile, the increasing original Fe content could also cause the increase of FeSe crystal size, therefore, the (00l) texture of FeSe bulks was enhanced, which would be beneficial to the intergrain connections. M\u00f6ssbauer spectra have been performed to study the magnetic orders in obtained FeSe bulks. A clear hyperfine magnetic sextet corresponding to the magnetic ordering with Hf of 333.0 kOe can be related to residual Fe in the bulks with Fe content higher than 1.10. The magnetic and superconducting properties of obtained bulks underwent a systematical change with original Fe content. The increasing Fe content can obviously enhance the superconducting performance of FeSe bulks and the optimal critical temperature, Tc of 9.0 K was obtained with original Fe content of 1.20.", "(Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.10Ti0.90)O3 (BCZT) ceramics were prepared by Plasma Activated Sintering (PAS) followed by annealing, and the effect of annealing temperature on structural and electrical properties was investigated. XRD patterns and Raman spectra indicated that all the BCZT ceramics annealed at different temperatures exhibited MPB structure consisting of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. A strong dependence of piezoelectric, dielectric and ferroelectric properties on annealing temperature was observed in the annealed BCZT ceramics. With increasing annealing temperature, the Curie temperature shifted toward lower temperature, while the activation energy of both grains and grain boundaries decreased gradually. BCZT ceramics annealed at the optimum temperature of 1400\u00a0\u00b0C exhibited the best properties of d33\u00a0=\u00a0501\u00a0pC/N, \u03b5m\u00a0=\u00a014000 and Pr\u00a0=\u00a018.1\u00a0\u03bcC/cm2.", "Copper incorporated in Li3V2(PO4)3/C cathode materials for high-rate Li-ion batteries were prepared by a self-catalysed sol-gel approach followed by a sintering process. The effect of copper incorporating amounts on the crystal structure, morphology and related electrochemical properties of Li3V2(PO4)3/C was investigated. It is noteworthy that the impurity Li3PO4 phase can be effectively affected by copper-incorporating without any significant influence on the surface morphology and crystal structure; moreover, the carbon layer coated onto Li3V2(PO4)3-Cu0.05/C can be separated into the porous inner layer and the graphene-type outer layer. Benefiting from above two factors, copper-incorporated Li3V2(PO4)3/C composite with improved electrochemical properties has been achieved. In comparison with pure Li3V2(PO4)3/C, the Li3V2(PO4)3-Cu0.05/C composite delivers a reversible specific capacity of 123.3 mAh g\u22121 after 50 cycles at a current rate of 1C and 116.2 mAh g\u22121 at 10C, maintaining 98.2% and 89.5% of capacity retention, respectively, and even cycled at 20C rate, it still possesses 105.4 mAh g\u22121 of discharge capacity, demonstrating an excellent rate capability and cycling stability.", "In this study, we presented an effective approach for the substantial coercivity enhancement of Dy-free sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets with Ga-doping. The coercivity was substantially enhanced from 10.1\u00a0kOe to 19.8\u00a0kOe by effective microstructure optimization and phase constitution regulation in antecedent alloys. A good isolation of 2:14:1 grains by Nd-rich intergranular phase is obtained in final magnets accompanying with the formation of intermetallic Nd6Fe13Ga phase. However, when dehydrogenating above 500\u00a0\u00b0C, masses of preformed Nd6Fe13Ga phases are detected in the initial strip casting alloys and the homologous magnet suffers an unanticipated degradation of coercivity. Magnetic domain observation and thermal magnetic analysis imply a pronounced difference in the magnetism of grain boundary (GB) phases, which closely associated with the composition homogeneity of Nd-rich phases in antecedent alloys. The mechanism of the coercivity variation in the sintered magnets with different GBs magnetism is discussed based on magnetic behavior analysis.", "The correlation between preparation conditions and microstructure as well as magnetic properties were studied for Sm(Co0.665Fe0.25Cu0.06Zr0.025)7 magnets. Increase of sintering temperature from 1468 to 1493\u202fK promotes the amalgamation of small grains into big ones, resulting in an enlargement of average grain size from 10 to 25\u202f\u03bcm and diffusion of Cu from inner grains to Cu-lean grain boundaries. As a result, the demagnetization curve squareness of the magnets improves substantially, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the maximum energy product from 21.3 to 27.1 MGOe. The coercivity of the magnets drops from 25.3 to 16.0\u202fkOe\u202fat the same time, which was verified by the increase of the average domain width from 1.1\u202f\u03bcm in small grains to 2.5\u202f\u03bcm in big grains. It is therefore concluded that tuning of the preparation conditions causes a more homogeneous distribution of Cu, which is crucial for the improvement of magnetic properties.", "For advanced high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), a novel anode material with a high capacity needs to be developed. In particular, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with a layered structure consisting of S-Mo-S formed by van der Waals force exhibits a high theoretical capacity (1280 mAh g\u22121). In this study, MoS2-TiN electrodes were fabricated using a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering deposition method by which MoS2 and TiN sputtering targets could be individually controlled. As the RF power of the TiN target increased (20, 40, 60\u202fW), the ratio of Ti in the electrodes increased and the ratio of Mo in the electrodes decreased. In particular, compared to pure MoS2, the MoS2-TiN with an optimum amount of TiN exhibited a high discharge capacity for 300 cycles and an improved high-rate cycling performance, i.e. an initial discharge capacity of 789.2 mAh g\u22121 with the maintained capacity of \u223c700 mAh g\u22121 for 300 cycles. This demonstrates that TiN in the MoS2-TiN could reduce the volumetric variation caused by the conversion reaction of MoS2 and assist in the improvement of the electrodes.", "Due to a variety of outstanding physical and chemical properties such as wide band gap, low resistance, good catalysis, high surface-to-volume ratio, high sensitivity and strong interaction with gas molecules, one-dimensional (1D) micro- and nanoscale indium oxide (In2O3) structures are capable for high-performance optical, electrical and chemical devices, which have attracted much attention in the last decade. In this paper, we first summarize various fabrication methods of 1D micro- and nanoscale In2O3 structures such as chemical vapor deposition, hydrothermal method, thermal evaporation method and electrospinning, then the interesting electrical and optical properties and their potential applications including gas sensors, field-emission transitions, photocatalysts and ultraviolet detectors are reviewed.

Sintering at 1030\u00b0C resulted in a single perovskite phase with tetragonal structure having uniform and dense microstructure as revealed by powder XRD, Raman spectroscopy and FESEM analyses. An excellent dielectric response was obtained with room temperature dielectric permittivity value of 142 and high-phase transition temperature (Tm) of 210\u00b0C at 1kHz. A huge value of piezoelectric charge coefficient (490pC/N) was obtained, which shows potential of PMN\u2013PT for piezoelectric device applications. Well-shaped and fatigue-free P\u2013E hysteresis loops over a wide temperature range of 30\u2013230\u00b0C were traced. A very large value of pyroelectric coefficient (p\u223c2739.2\u03bcCm\u22122\u00b0C\u22121) was obtained.", "Mechanical-phase mixtures of a phosphomolybdic cesium salt containing V and Te as counter-cations and \u03b1-La2Mo2O9 (LM) or \u03b2-La2Mo1.9V0.1O8.95 (LMV) have been studied as catalysts for the partial oxidation of isobutane into methacrylic acid (MAA) and methacrolein (MA). The catalysts with 50 wt.% of LMV in the phase mixture appeared very efficient at 360\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure with selectivity and yield into MAA and MA, respectively, equal to 59% and 12.4%. The characterization of the catalysts allowed to propose that the synergetic effect taking place between the phases results primarily from a support effect of the lanthanum molybdate stabilizing the phosphomolybdic salt and preventing its sintering. The origin of such effect has been related to crystallographic fits between the two phases. This type of structure- related synergetic effect had never been reported in catalytic oxidation reaction for which most of the time, the spreading of one phase on the other is taking place.", "A sensitive and selective liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) method for the determination of triazolam and its metabolites, alpha-hydroxytriazolam (\u03b1-OHTRZ) and 4-hydroxytriazolam (4-OHTRZ), was developed and validated. Triazolam-D4 was used as the internal standard (IS). This analysis was carried out on a Thermo\u00ae C18 column and the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile:H2O:formic acid (35:65:0.2, v/v/v). Detection was performed on a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer using positive ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI) and quantification was performed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MS/MS ion transitions monitored were m/z 343.1\u2192308.3, 359.0\u2192308.3, 359.0\u2192111.2 and 347.0\u2192312.0 for triazolam, \u03b1-OHTRZ, 4-OHTRZ and triazolam-D4, respectively. LLOQ of the analytical method was 0.05ng/mL for triazolam and 0.1ng/mL for \u03b1-OHTRZ and 4-OHTRZ. The within- and between-run precisions were less than 15.26% and accuracy was \u22128.08% to 13.33%. The method proved to be accurate and specific, and was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of triazolam in healthy Chinese volunteers.", "A sensitive, selective, and rapid ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (uHPLC\u2013MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous quantification of clopidogrel (Plavix\u00ae) and its derivatized active metabolite (CAMD) in human plasma. Derivatization of the active metabolite in blood with 2-bromo-3\u2032-methoxy acetophenone (MPB) immediately after collection ensured metabolite stability during sample handling and storage. Following addition of ticlopidine as an internal standard and simple protein precipitation, the analytes were separated on a Waters Acquity UPLC\u2122 sub-2\u03bcm-C18 column via gradient elution before detection on a triple-quadrupole MS with multiple-reaction-monitoring via electrospray ionization. The method was validated across the clinically relevant concentration range of 0.01\u201350ng/mL for parent clopidogrel and 0.1\u2013150ng/mL (r 2 =0.99) for CAMD, with a fast run time of 1.5min to support pharmacokinetic studies using 75, 150, or 300mg oral doses of clopidogrel. The analytical method measured concentrations of clopidogrel and CAMD with accuracy (%DEV) \u00b112% and precision (%CV) of \u00b16%. The method was successfully applied to measure the plasma concentrations of clopidogrel and CAMD in three subjects administered single oral doses of 75, 150, and 300mg clopidogrel. It was further demonstrated that the derivatizing agent (MPB) does not affect clopidogrel levels, thus from one aliquot of blood drawn clinically, this method can simultaneously quantify both clopidogrel and CAMD with sensitivity in the picogram per mL range.", "We report on the effects of high hydrogen dilution on the optical (refractive index, absorption coefficient and band gap) and electrical (carrier concentration, Hall mobility and dark conductivity) properties of boron-doped nc-Si:H thin films grown by PECVD on glass substrates through X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering, transmission and Hall measurements at room temperature. Wavelength-dependent refractive indices and absorption coefficients are obtained through a modified four-layer-medium transmission model based on the envelope method. The carrier concentration, Hall mobility and dark conductivity are related to the boron-doping effect and the crystallinity of the nc-Si:H samples. The hydrogen dilution ratio is found to increase basically both the incorporation efficiency of the boron dopant atoms and the crystallinity. The results are discussed in the framework of the growth mechanism for the boron-doped nc-Si:H taking into account the etching effect of atomic hydrogen and the doping effect of boron.", "We demonstrate that single-crystalline epitaxial films of the Heusler alloyCo2Cr0.6Fe0.4 Al(CCFA) featuring excellent surface flatness can be grown on MgO (001) substrates by magnetron sputtering deposition at room temperature and subsequent annealing at high temperatures. X-ray pole figure measurements reveal that the films exhibit the B2-type structure and the [100] direction of the films is rotated by 45\u00b0from the [100] direction of the MgO substrate. Moreover, their Curie temperatures and saturation magnetizations are also improved by annealing. The surface roughness is about 0.2nmrms according to atomic force microscopy.", "The Ga1\u2212xMnxN epitaxial films were grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with tricarbonyl (methycyclopentadienyl) manganese ((MCP)2Mn) as dopant source. Magnetic measurements indicate that the films are n-type conductivity (x=0.01), ferromagnetic ordering with Curie temperature above room temperature. The magnetic moment per Mn atom decreases when the Mn concentration changes from 0.01 to 0.03. Magneto-transport properties were performed in the temperature range of 2\u2013300K. The magneto-resistance (MR) changes from negative effect to positive effect with increasing temperature. The negative MR effect at low temperature is due to the reduction of the magnetic scattering of the Mn ions under the applied magnetic field. Furthermore, the zero-field-cooled (ZFC)/field-cooled (FC) and MR behavior at low temperature confirm that the ferromagnetism and paramagnetism coexist in Ga1\u2212xMnxN films.", "(Pb1\u2212x,Srx)TiO3 (PST) thin films with various Sr content (x=0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) were fabricated on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. With the increase of Sr content, the structure of PST films changed from tetragonal to cubic symmetry and the grain size slightly decreased. Dielectric and ferroelectric properties were highly depended on the composition of PST films. PST (x=0.2) films showed a good polarization-switching characteristic with a relatively lower dielectric constant. PST (x=0.6) films displayed the excellent tunable dielectric property with a low loss tangent and performed well on the insulating characteristic. These results illustrated that PST thin films with a suitable composition have potential for applications in nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory, dynamic random access memory and tunable devices.", "The alloy AlxGa1\u2212xN was grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using a high-temperature AlN interlayer on a thick GaN template. The Al composition (x) of the AlxGa1\u2212xN was varied in the range 0.13\u2a7dx\u2a7d0.8. The in-situ reflectance spectra indicate that the growth process of AlGaN alloys is dominated by trimethylgallium (TMGa) molar flux when the molar flux of trimethylaluminium (TMAl) is kept constant. The Al compositions and growth rates of AlGaN alloys were determined by Rutherford backscattering, which indicates that the incorporation efficiency of TMAl is improved remarkably by decreasing the TMGa molar flux. The crystalline quality of these AlGaN alloys is evaluated by measuring the symmetric (002) and asymmetric (102) \u03c9-scan X-ray diffraction peak widths. The best crystalline quality, among these AlxGa1\u2212xN alloys, is for an Al composition of x=0.54 where the full-width at half-maximums of the AlGaN (002) and (102) diffraction peaks are 265 and 797arcsec, respectively. This conclusion is consistent with the surface morphology of the AlGaN alloys probed by atomic force microscopy. Room temperature cathodoluminescence spectra show pronounced near band edge emission from these AlGaN alloys. The optical band gaps (Eg) are found to deviate from linear interpolation between EgGaN and EgAlN with a bowing parameter b=0.89.", "High-quality Zn1\u2212xCoxO (ZnCoO) thin films with different Co concentrations (x=0\u22120.07) were synthesized on Al2O3 substrates using a radio-frequency magnetron sputtering process. The structural, chemical, optical, and electrical properties of the films were characterized using various techniques. High-resolution X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the ZnCoO films had a c-oriented hexagonal wurtzite structure with no extra phases. The lattice constants of the films increased slightly with increasing the Co concentration ratio. X-ray photoelectron spectra show the incorporation of Co2+ ions in the ZnO host without the formations of Co clusters. Hall measurements revealed that the films were n-type with a charge carrier density of \u223c2.6\u00d7 10 18 per cm3. A neutral-donor bound exciton peak (D0X) from all specimens was observed at 3.36eV using photoluminescence measurements at 10K. The physical and chemical properties of the films suggested that their ferromagnetic properties originated from a direct exchange interaction between magnetic Co ions.", "We report on the growth of high Mg content, high quality, wurtzite MgxZn1\u2212xO (MgZnO) epitaxial films using a pulsed metal organic chemical vapor deposition (PMOCVD) method. Series of MgZnO films with variable Mg concentration were deposited on bare and AlN coated sapphire substrates. The band gap of the films estimated using UV\u2013visible transmission spectra ranges from 3.24eV to 4.49eV, corresponding to fraction of Mg between x=0.0 and x=0.51, as determined by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. The cathodoluminescence (CL) measurement has shown a blue-shift in the peak position of MgZnO with an increasing Mg content. No multi-absorption edges and CL band splitting were observed, suggesting the absence of phase segregation in the as grown films. The crystal structure and phase purity of the films were also confirmed by XRD analysis. Hall effect measurement in van der Pauw configuration was employed to evaluate the electrical properties of the films. With a rise in Mg incorporation into the ZnO lattice, the films became very resistive, consistent with the widening of the band gap. The AFM measurement on the films has shown a decreasing surface roughness with an Mg content. To the best of our knowledge, the current result shows the highest Mg content (x=0.51), high quality, wurtzite MgZnO epitaxial film ever grown by MOCVD. The high Mg incorporation without phase separation is believed to be due to the non-equilibrium behavior of the PMOCVD in which the kinetic processes dominate the thermodynamic one.", "Integration of ferroelectric tunable components into dielectric layers of low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) systems enables the realization of more functional multilayer ceramic modules (MCMs) for telecommunication applications. A composition designed for the low temperature sintering of ferroelectric BST material has been developed based upon previous work. Small amount of manganese is introduced to modify the properties of ferroelectric BaSrTiO3 LTCC compositions. The effects of manganese on sintering behaviour, microstructure, relative permittivity, dissipation factor and tunability are studied. Manganese enhances the sintering of the BST due to an increase in the amount of oxygen vacancies and which yields an improvement in the electrical properties of BST.", "A high magnetic field of 10T was introduced into a processing of slip casting for fabricating (Ca,Sr)Bi4Ti4O15 (abbreviated as CSBT) ceramics. Feeble magnetic CSBT particles in green compacts were partially aligned through rotating a gypsum mold containing the CSBT slurry in the magnetic field. The green compacts were sintered at 1200\u00b0C for different time without magnetic field. With increasing of the sintering time, the preferable orientation degree of CSBT ceramics rapidly went up at the initial stage, and then slowly increased at the medium and final stages. The mechanism of the orientation degree increasing during the sintering can be attributed to a processing in which large oriented particles coarsen small randomly oriented particle.", "Thin-films of La2Ti2O7 were obtained by dip-coating process using a precursor salt in nitric acid solution. The effects of solution concentration, withdrawal speed, post-annealing duration and temperature were investigated both on grain size and orientation of the La2Ti2O7 thin layers. In addition, a target with the required stoichiometry for PVD deposition of La-substituted Bi4Ti3O12 (BLT) was successfully sintered by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 750\u00b0C. Finally (011)-oriented BLT ferroelectric films have been grown by RF sputtering on (110)-oriented La2Ti2O7 polycrystalline thin-film. A preferential orientation of BLT thin films has been obtained after annealing at a temperature lower than 650\u00b0C.", "Zn1\u2212xNixO dense ceramics were prepared from Zn1\u2212xNixO nanoparticles with x varying from 0 to 0.06. These nanoparticles were synthesized by liquid route. In the sintered samples, the solubility limit of Ni in the Zn1\u2212xNixO wurtzite structure was found to be 0.03. The increase of x until 0.03 led to a significant raise in both electrical conductivity (\u03c3) and absolute value of Seebeck coefficient (|S|). Ni-richer samples (x>0.03) contained in addition a small amount of Ni rich secondary phase (ZnyNizO) with a cubic structure similar to NiO. The thermoelectric properties of all samples were investigated from room temperature to 1000K. All doped samples showed a n-type semiconducting conductivity. For Ni contents higher than x=0.03, the increase of the secondary phase content induced a decrease in \u03c3 and |S|. The highest power factor (0.6mWm\u22121K\u22122) and ZT (0.09) were found for Zn0.97Ni0.03O at 1000K.", "The properties of the bulk materials consolidated of silica coreshell powders with iron oxide core have been studied. Iron oxide nanoparticles smaller than 20nm in size were synthesized by a reverse co-precipitation process in ambient atmosphere. Coreshell structures with various amounts of iron oxide were prepared via a modified St\u00f6ber method. The powders were compacted by using pulsed electric current sintering (PECS) at 1373K. The morphologies, microstructures, phases, optical, and magnetic properties of the samples were studied by using transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV\u2013visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013Vis), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Transmittance values in the 250\u2013800nm range varied with the amount of iron oxide. Sample with the lower content was transparent while the sample with the highest content was opaque with microporosity. The compact with the highest iron oxide content showed the ferromagnetic behaviour at 300K. The phase transformations in the coreshell powders during the sintering process are discussed.", "Neodymium (Nd) doped intergrowth bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric compounds Bi7\u2212xNdxTi4NbO21 (x=0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75 and 2.0) were synthesized through a solid-state method. The influence of the Nd3+ substitution of Bi3+ on the lattice, microstructure and electrical properties of these compounds were investigated. The X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering analyses demonstrate that a phase transition from orthorhombic to pseudo-tetragonal occurs in these compounds, relying on substitution proportions and sites of Nd3+ for Bi3+. With the increasing Nd3+ dopants, the growth of plate-like grains along the a\u2013b plane and a secondary intergranular metallic Bi phase were retarded which resulted in the increases of sintering temperature, density and electrical resistance of the doped ceramics. The resultant ceramic with x=1.25 possesses a piezoelectric coefficient d33 up to 16.3pC/N with a Curie temperature TC above 750\u00b0C were obtained for the compound.", "In this paper we studied the structural, dielectric, magnetic and magnetoelectric properties of (x)BaTiO3\u2013(1\u2212x)Co0.6Zn0.4Fe1.7Mn0.3O4 particulate composite series where x=0.50, 0.60 and 0.70. BaTiO3\u2013Co0.6Zn0.4Fe1.7Mn0.3O4 composite has the advantage of being non-toxic and environmental friendly from the point of view of device fabrication. High ME voltage coefficients were obtained in the whole series with the highest value of \u03b1E\u223c73mV/cmOe achieved in sample x=0.50 containing equal mole fractions of both the component phases. This value of \u03b1E is an order of magnitude higher than that of particulate sintered BaTiO3\u2013CoFe2O4 composites (\u223c2\u20134mV/cmOe). Dielectric characteristics for these samples indicated two anomalies: (i) one at low temperature close to ferroelectric to paraelectric transition temperature of pure BaTiO3 and (ii) another at higher temperature related to the magnetic transition in ferrite, a characteristic dielectric feature of composite sample.", "Most applications of hexaferrites require sintered products, but sintering of hexaferrites at high temperatures degrades their magnetic properties and cannot be used as low-temperature co-fired ceramics. Additionally, due to the magnetic uniaxial anisotropy of hexaferrites, excellent magnetic properties are attained when the particles are aligned along the magnetic easy-axis. In order to overcome these problems, herein we suggest a new method to decrease the sintering temperature and improve the simultaneous alignment of magnetic particles along the easy-axis. NaCl-barium hexaferrite particles and NaCl-amorphous particles were sintered using the spark plasma sintering process. Using this method, a sintered body with a relative density of 92.5% and 70.2% alignment was fabricated at 800\u00b0C for 5min. In this method, the added NaCl played a significant role in facilitating the low temperature sintering and particle alignment. This method was found to be effective for low temperature sintering and nano-scale particle alignment.", "A wide variety of energy harvesting materials have been investigated for renewable energy applications. Piezoelectric energy harvesters have attracted attention because of their versatility and reliability. In this work, we prepared (1\u2212x)(Na0.5K0.5)NbO3\u2013x(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 piezoelectric ceramics through conventional mixed oxide fabrication methods with different amounts of (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 and various sintering temperatures. We then analyzed the electrical and structural properties of the resulting materials in an attempt to determine the optimal fabrication conditions for enhanced piezoelectric properties. The crystalline properties and surface morphology of (1\u2212x)(Na0.5K0.5)NbO3\u2013x(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics were examined via X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. We systematically investigated the effect of the sintering temperature on the microstructure, piezoelectric properties, and ferroelectric properties of the materials. The output voltage generated by the (1\u2212x)(Na0.5K0.5)NbO3\u2013x(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramics was measured by a mechanical force system. Optimizing the sintering temperature improved the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of (1\u2212x)(Na0.5K0.5)NbO3\u2013x(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramics, increasing their viability for use in energy-harvesting applications.", "In view of developing new structures and processes for the production of magnetoelectric materials, bilayer thick structures made of cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4)/titanium dioxide (TiO2) composite and niobium-doped lead zirconate titanate (PZTN) were grown on silver-coated alumina substrates by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) from ethanol-based colloidal suspensions. A first co-deposition from a CoFe2O4/TiO2 suspension was followed, after heat treatments of the electrodeposited composite layer, by a second deposition from a PZTN suspension. Each deposition was performed at constant voltage while recording the current. High density structures keeping the same stoichiometry of the deposited particles were observed after sintering. Composition, thickness and relative density of the layers were investigated by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses, while the crystalline phases were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Ferroelectric, hysteresis loops and piezoelectric response of the bilayer thick structures were measured resulting in good piezoelectric activity of the poled structures.", "Samples in the system Bi1\u2212xYbxFeO3 (0.02\u2264\u00d7\u22640.07) have for the first time been prepared by mechanical activation followed by sintering. XRD and DSC measurements show that the solubility limit of ytterbium in the R3c Bi1\u2212xYbxFeO3 system is reached at x\u223c0.03. Higher ytterbium contents lead to a two-phase mixture of a main R3c phase of approximate composition Bi0.97Yb0.03FeO3 and ytterbium enriched secondary phases that cannot be readily indexed or quantified due to their small amount. DSC and temperature-dependent XRD showed that while the magnetic ordering temperature, TN, was unaffected by Yb substitution, the ferroelectric ordering, TC, declined. Temperature-dependent XRD patterns show that all samples exhibit rhombohedral R3c to orthorrhombic Pnma phase transitions. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy suggests the potential use of the samples in photocatalytic applications due to their low band gap energy. Impedance spectroscopy and magnetic measurements show that samples are electrically homogenous and highly insulating, exhibiting antiferromagnetic behaviour at room temperature.", "Lead-free Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-SrTiO3 incipient piezoceramics with Li2CO3 and MnO2 additives were successfully fabricated at low firing temperature for applications in co-fired multilayer piezoactuators. The addition of Li2CO3 effectively shifted the sintering temperature from 1230\u00b0C down to 1075\u00b0C, where the ceramics were co-fired with a Ag/Pd (75/25) inner electrode. The prototype actuators were prepared by tape-casting method using ceramics with the composition of 0.74Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.26 SrTiO3+0.15wt%MnO2+0.45wt%Li2CO3. The total number of active layers was 13, and each ceramic layer had a thickness of 60\u03bcm. The actuator output a large strain up to \u223c0.20% at a driving field of 4kV/mm, due to the field-induced phase transition between the ergodic relaxor and ferroelectric phases. The excellent voltage-displacement performance of the prototype actuator demonstrates the potential for industrial applications.", "The high-Curie temperature (TC) 0.15Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.38PbHfO3-0.47PbTiO3 (PMN-PH-PT) piezoelectric ceramics were prepared by the partial oxalate route via the B-site oxide mixing method. The obtained uniform nm-sized PMN-PH-PT precursor powders provide high calcining and sintering activity for synthesizing ceramics, based on which the synthesis conditions were tailored as calcining at 775\u00b0C and sintering at 1245\u00b0C. The partial oxalate route synthesized PMN-PH-PT ceramics are far superior to the counterparts synthesized by the columbite precursor method and exhibit excellent thermal stability of the piezoelectric properties under TC (\u223c292\u00b0C), ensuring the potential application in transducers under elevated environmental temperatures. The temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy not only proves the occurrence of the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition around TC, but also confirms the successive phase symmetry transitions, which correlate with the polar nanoregions (PNRs) and/or the coexistence of multiple ferroelectric phases, revealing the origin of the enhanced electrical properties in the PMN-PH-PT ceramics.", "Lu2O3:Pr,Ti storage phosphors were prepared by means of high temperature (1700\u00b0C) sintering both in a reducing atmosphere of the N2-H2 mixture (3:1 by volume) and in ambient air. Their thermoluminescent (TL) properties were presented and discussed. Pr singly-doped material showed only very inefficient TL. Ti co-doping boosted the TL efficacy, and the most potent TL was observed for ceramics containing 0.05mol% of Pr and 0.007mol% of Ti and made in the reducing atmosphere. Samples prepared in air produced noticeably less intense TL. The glow curves of both materials consisted of one broad asymmetric band with the maximum around 357\u00b0C for the heating rate of 4.7\u00b0C/s. The glow peaks could be fitted with three (reduced samples) or two (air-sintered) components. The latter lacked the high-temperature part of TL compared to the former. Tmax-Tstop experiments indicated that the TL is connected with continuous distribution of trap depths, which were estimated to cover the range of ~ 1.7 to 2.3eV, and their specific values were slightly dependent on the methodology. Anomalous dependence of the TL intensity on the heating rate made the semi-localized transition the likely mechanism affecting the TL properties of Lu2O3:Pr,Ti ceramics. The collected data allowed to construct vacuum referred binding energy (VRBE) level scheme with Pr3+ and Ti3+/4+ energy levels in the band gap of Lu2O3 host that could explain the TL mechanism in Lu2O3:Pr,Ti ceramics.", "We have studied the effect of post deposition annealing on the structure and magnetic properties of NdFeB films sputtered on Si (100) substrate. After annealing the films exhibit hard magnetic properties with room coercivities up to 7.3kOe and maximum energy product of 19.6MGOe.", "Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B films were prepared by DC magnetron sputtering and the effect of buffer layer and annealing conditions on the magnetic properties have been investigated. High degree of texture, highest coercivity and energy product are achieved in Ta-buffered films deposited on heated substrates. A linear increase of coercivity with film thickness up to 10\u03bcm is observed.", "The Barkhausen effect was experimentally investigated in sintered NdFeB hard magnetic materials. We analyzed noise properties along different magnetization curves. The jumps are associated with the reversal of single grains or of groups of grains. The comparison of noise properties along different curves gives experimental support to the nucleation-type picture. Jump-size distributions follow a power law with critical exponent 1.2, and with exponential cutoff depending on magnetization curve considered. The maximum cutoff size is correlated to a microstructural limit due to the average grain size.", "CuFe2\u2212x Alx O4 (where x=0.0\u20130.6) have been synthesized at 950\u00b0C, 1000\u00b0C, 1050\u00b0C and 1100\u00b0C using the usual ceramic method. The M\u00f6ssbauer measurements show reasonable values of magnetic as well as electric hyperfine interactions. At higher sintering temperatures, the spinel ferrite phase is partially dissociated forming delafossite phase in addition to the main matrix. The delafossite phase manifested itself as paramagnetic doublet overlapping the main M\u00f6ssbauer spectra measured at room temperature. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the presence of the CuFeO2 (delafossite) phase of Cu\u2013Al ferrite.", "A series of ferrites was prepared using microwave sintering, starting with both hematite and magnetite precursors in the Ni1\u2212xZnxFe2O4 (x=0\u22121) system. X-ray diffraction measurements were performed to yield the lattice constant as function of the amount x of Zn substitution. For both hematite and magnetite series, the lattice parameter was found to increase with increasing x. M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy was performed at room temperature and spectra were analyzed using the binomial distribution. The hyperfine magnetic field of the octahedral sublattice was found to decrease with increasing the number of Zn nearest neighbors for all values of the substitution level. The area of the tetrahedral sublattice decreases with increasing x and the sublattice area of the octahedral sites increases correspondingly for both series of samples, as a result of substitution of iron by zinc in the tetrahedral sites. The hyperfine magnetic field of the tetrahedral sublattice was found to decrease as function of Zn amount x, for both hematite and magnetite series. However, in most cases, the hyperfine magnetic fields for the magnetite series are slightly less than those corresponding to the hematite series.", "Polycrystalline ferromagnetic(F)/antiferromagnetic(AF) exchange biased bilayers of NiFe/MnNi have been grown by RF sputtering. The measured hysteresis loops are shifted and exhibit a strong asymmetry along the easy axis of the F film. The dynamic properties have been investigated through Complex Permeability frequency Spectra measurements in the 100MHz\u20136GHz range. The dispersion relation of the resonance frequency of imaginary part of the permeability shows hysteretic behavior when measured in presence of a static magnetic field applied along the easy axis of the F layer. A model for magnetization reversal in such bilayer based on the exchange energy development into Fourier-like power series is used. We show that it is possible to fit, with a set of parameters, the experimental asymmetric shape of hysteresis loop of the exchange biased bilayer. The same set of fit parameters are used to calculate the dispersion relation. The hysteretic behavior of the experimental resonance frequencies was found to be in agreement with theoretical results. Such a model reconciles irreversible (such as hysteresis loop) and reversible (such as AC permeability) measurements of the exchange bias.", "Nanoscale Fe(110) layers have been fabricated on \u03b1-Al2O3 using DC magnetron sputtering with Au(111) or Ag(111) as a buffer layer. Atomic force microscopy shows that Au(111) grows as a continuous layer and Ag(111) grows as nanoislands of irregular shapes and sizes. Magneto-optic Kerr effect shows that a 12nm Fe(110) layer deposited on Au(111) at 295K and on Ag(111) at 640K is ferromagnetic at room temperature. In-plane magnetic anisotropy is observed for the Fe(110) layer on Au(111). The layer thickness, the surface coverage and the magnetization of the films have been determined by polarized neutron reflectometry.", "The copper ferrite CuFe2O4 films deposited at 50 and 200W RF power on fused quartz substrates and subsequently heat treated were investigated by polar magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) spectroscopy at photon energies ranging from 1.2 to 5eV. CuFe2O4 films can be stabilized in two phases at room temperature depending on deposition conditions and post-deposition thermal treatment, i.e., (a) cubic with high magnetization and (b) tetragonal with low magnetization. The differences are due to cation redistribution and Jahn\u2013Teller distortions and manifest themselves in the MOKE spectra.", "Thin ferromagnetic Fe\u2013Co\u2013Ta\u2013N and Fe\u2013Co\u2013Al\u2013N films with strong in-plane uniaxial anisotropy were successfully prepared by RF reactive magnetron sputtering and subsequent vacuum field annealing. The magnetic properties of as-deposited and field annealed films were investigated in order to optimise the deposition and annealing conditions. The films exhibit good soft magnetic properties and an excellent thermal stability because of their nanocrystalline microstructure. The critical temperature of degradation of the magnetic properties is around 500\u00b0C; therefore, the films can be integrated in a standard semiconductor CMOS process. After a 1-h heat treatment at 400\u00b0C, the following magnetic properties were achieved: saturation polarisation J s=1.2T, coercive field \u03bc 0 H c = 0.3 mT , electrical resistivity \u03c1 =2\u00d710\u22126 \u03a9 m, anisotropy field \u03bc 0 H a = 3.5 \u2013 5 mT . This results in a ferromagnetic resonance frequency of f r=1.8\u20132.1GHz and initial permeability of \u03bc low = 400 \u2013 300 . The influence of intrinsic material parameters, such as saturation polarisation, uniaxial anisotropy field, electrical resistivity and film thickness, on HF permeability was analysed. The frequency-dependent permeability spectra were measured up to 4.5GHz with a strip line permeameter.", "Epitaxial CrO2 thin films were grown onto TiO2 (100) single-crystalline substrates by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process with use of the solid precursor CrO3. The CrO2 films with thickness of 27 and 65nm were deposited onto TiO2 substrates pre-etched in the diluted HF. The magnetic properties of the epitaxial chromium-dioxide films have been probed by the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) technique. Analysis of the FMR spectra shows that the magnetic behaviour of the CrO2 films results from a competition between magnetocrystalline and strain anisotropies. The thin films are heavily strained due to lattice mismatch of CrO2 epitaxial film with the TiO2 single-crystalline substrate. For the thinnest film (27nm) the stress anisotropy dominates, and the magnetic easy axis switches from the c direction to the b direction of the rutile structure. Unusual angular dependence of the resonance signal and multiple FMR modes are observed for the film with the thickness of 65nm, where a partial strain relaxation results in appearance of two magnetic phases with mutually perpendicular easy axes along the c and b directions.", "In this work we show the magnetic characteristics of perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ) with different oxidation layers. The pMTJs structures were made by RF and DC magnetron sputtering. Individual depositions of magnesium oxide layers and of aluminum oxide films were prepared by plasma oxidation. The experimental results showed that the initial switching field was decreased as the magnesium oxide thickness was increased. Further work of the aluminum oxide surface roughness and hysteresis loop influenced by different oxidation layers on pMTJs structures will be discussed as well.", "The relaxation of the initial magnetic permeability has been measured in polycrystalline hexaferrites with nominal composition BaO\u00b76Fe2O3 (i.e. M-type). The samples have been sintered at different temperatures in CO2 atmosphere and with different manufacturing conditions. In temperature range between 80 and 500K, the magnetic disaccommodation shows presence of different relaxation processes, depending on both the sintering temperature and sintering time. The analogies and differences between the results obtained are discussed in terms of similar phase formation and different crystallite size.", "Mixed manganese-zinc and nickel-zinc ferrites of composition Mn0.2Ni0.8\u2212xZnxFe2O4 where x = 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 have been synthesized by the citrate precursor technique. Decomposition of the precursor at temperatures as low as 500\u00b0C gives the ferrite powder. The ferrites have been investigated for their electrical and magnetic properties such as saturation magnetization, initial permeability, Curie temperature, AC-resistivity and dielectric constant as a function of sintering temperature and zinc content. Structural properties such as lattice parameter, grain size and density are also studied. The mixed compositions exhibited higher saturation magnetizations at sintering temperatures as low as 1200\u00b0C. While the Curie temperature decreased with zinc content, the permeability was found to increase. The AC-resistivity ranged from 105\u2013107\u03a9cm and decreased with zinc content and sintering temperature. The dielectric constants were lower than those normally reported for the Mn\u2013Zn ferrites. Samples sintered at 1400\u00b0C densified to about 94% of the theoretical density and the grain size was of the order of about 1.5\u03bcm for the samples sintered at 1200\u00b0C and increased subsequently with sintering temperature.", "By DC-sputtering from a stoichiometric target onto sapphire substrates we prepared epitaxial films ofNi2 MnGa . X-ray diffraction in two circle geometry shows only theNi2 MnGapeaks corresponding to a (110) oriented growth on the (110) oriented sapphire substrate. Rocking curve scans shows that the out of plane orientation has a width of only 1. 1\u2218. By four circle X-ray diffraction we find an in-plane aligned growth. The Curie temperature as determined by SQUID magnetometry is 368K. On cooling down the low field magnetization drops at around 260\u2013280K indicating the austenite to martensite transition. The presence of two different phases at high and low temperature also shows up in temperature-dependent X-ray measurements. The element specific magnetic moments for thin film samples have been determined by magnetic circular X-ray dichroism (XMCD) measurements.", "Magnetic properties of CoCrPt\u2013SiO2 films using facing target sputtering system were investigated. CoCrPt\u2013SiO2/Ru thin films were deposited directly on slide glass substrate and flexible tape substrate (ARAMID) without seed layers in various sputtering conditions aiming for development of CoCrPt\u2013SiO2 magnetic recording tape media. It was suggested that the Ar gas pressure in fabrication of magnetic layer and underlayer had an influence on magnetic property. Ru (001) orientation was degraded at high Ar gas pressure in fabrication of underlayer. Longitudinal magnetic recording layer can be fabricated on tape substrate without seed layer. Coercivity and M r/M s of that film were 4270Oe and 0.78, respectively.", "We propose and demonstrate an edge magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure that uses the edge part of the magnetic thin film and the barrier layer parallel to the edge surface. The shape of an edge MTJ becomes a rectangle whose area is defined as the product of the thickness of one magnetic thin film and the line width of another magnetic film. The thickness of a thin film is reduced in a controlled manner so that the edge junction structure can have a smaller area as well as a smaller variation in area. In the case of the edge junction, a rectangular aspect ratio is enlarged without increasing the area of the cell. An in situ ion milling etching apparatus is connected to the sputtering system in order to avoid the oxidation of the edge surface. In our fabrication process of the edge MTJs, magnetic electrodes are not exposed to water, oxygen plasma, or organic solvent. The edge MTJs consist of CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB. We obtain both a high magnetoresistance ratio (MR) of 71% and a small area of 0.3\u00d70.04\u03bcm in the edge MTJ.", "The structural and magnetic properties of Co 2 Cr 0.6 Fe 0.4 Al (CCFA) thin films epitaxially grown on GaAs substrates by sputtering were investigated. The CCFA film directly grown on GaAs showed a cube-on-cube crystallographic relation, while it was rotated by 45 \u2218 in the (001) plane when a thin MgO layer was inserted between the CCFA and GaAs. Both samples showed strong magnetic anisotropy, in which a uniaxial anisotropy with an easy axis of [ 1 1 0 ] GaAs or [ 1 \u2013 10 ] GaAs dominated with a slight cubic anisotropy having easy axes of \u3008 1 1 0 \u3009 CCFA superimposed. The uniaxial anisotropy constants were approximately 1.6 times as large as the cubic anisotropy constants for both samples.", "Microstructure and magnetic properties of Mn\u2013X\u2013N (X: Ni, Zr, and B) alloy system were investigated in this study. The samples showed low remanence; however, relatively high coercivities of 0.5\u20134.4kOe (40\u2013350kA/m) were obtained in the Mn\u2013Ni\u2013N system. Scanning electron microscopy\u2013energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM\u2013EDX) and transmission electron microscopy\u2013energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (TEM-EDX) analyses revealed that the Mn\u2013Ni\u2013N sample with high coercivity consists of a lamellar structure with the spacing of 0.5\u20132\u03bcm. It is also found that the lamellar structure is composed of two phases with composition of 97.4at%Mn\u20132.6at%Ni and 86.7at%Mn\u201313.3at%Ni.", "Polycrystalline TERFENOL-D/PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) bilayer films were deposited using RF magnetron sputtering on Pt(111)/MgO(100) substrates for the purpose of studying voltage control of magnetization easy axis. TERFENOL-D films deposited at 500\u00b0C on PZT show in-plane anisotropy. In our samples where the voltage is applied perpendicular to the PZT film plane, TERFENOL-D films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are only suitable for the above mentioned study. TERFENOL-D/PZT bilayer films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be obtained by annealing in a perpendicular magnetic field at temperatures between 200 and 350\u00b0C. However, deposition and annealing of TERFENOL-D films at high-temperatures (\u2a7e350\u00b0C) causes degradation of the ferroelectric properties of PZT. In order to preserve the good switching characteristics of PZT films and to observe this effect at low voltages, TERFENOL-D films have to be deposited and annealed at low temperatures (350\u00b0C).", "Linear polarized EXAFS has been used to detect the presence of atom pair ordering in amorphous Fe\u2013Si thin films with a well-defined in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy to determine if such a pair ordering is the main cause of their magnetic anisotropy. The studied samples were deposited by magnetron sputtering with the Si concentration at the eutectic point of the alloy (36at% Si) and near the point the alloy becomes non-magnetic (49at% Si). Si was evaporated at an oblique angle. Only the most silicided alloy had its easy axis oriented perpendicular to the plane of incidence of the Si atoms. The experiment showed atom pair ordering only in the least silicided films. This discards atom pair ordering as the origin of the magnetic anisotropy in the most silicide films, which was magnetically the most anisotropic.", "We have studied the magnetic properties of co-sputtered Ni 0.89 Fe 0.11 single layers (10\u2013100nm) and Ni 0.89 Fe 0.11 / Ni 0.89 Fe 0.11 bilayers (10nm/10nm to 100nm/100nm) grown on glass substrates. Hysteresis loops and transverse biased initial susceptibility measurements were performed by transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect from both film/air and film/glass interfaces. The individual layers show in-plane uniaxial easy axes produced by the oblique incidence of incoming atom beams. For thinner bilayers (up to 20nm/20nm) the overall magnetic behavior can be justified by competing effective uniaxial and biaxial anisotropies acting over the average magnetization. For thicker bilayers (40nm/40nm and above), both transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements and micromagnetic simulations suggest the existence of a Bloch-type magnetic wall extending across the thickness of the bilayer.", "Z-type hexaferrites with composition of Ba3(Co0.4Zn0.6)2Fe24O41+x wt% Bi2O3 (where x=0\u20132) were prepared by a solid-state reaction method. The effects of different mixing procedures and Bi2O3 content on the sintering behavior, phase composition, microstructure and magnetic properties of the samples were investigated. It was confirmed that with the same secondary mixing time (t 2), increasing the primary mixing time (t 1) leads to a decrease of the average grain size and an increase of the initial density. The initial density and the distribution of particles and pores determined the sintering density. With t 1=24h and t 2=6h, the sintering density reached its maximum. The initial permeability and Q-factor also peaked, which could be attributed to the highest sintering density and compact microstructure. Further studies showed that with increasing Bi2O3 content, the major phase changed to the Z-phase; simultaneously, the remnants content of intermediate phase decreased. The Bi2O3 additive, as a reaction center, promoted the grain growth at lower temperatures. The decrease of the sintering temperature and the partial agglomeration of Bi2O3 on the grain boundaries restrained abnormal grain growth, thus closed pores in grains were not formed. A maximum initial permeability, a higher Q-factor, a cut-off frequency of 900MHz and a resonance frequency above 1.8GHz were obtained for the sample with 0.6wt% Bi2O3 sintered at low temperature.", "Magnetic refrigeration is an innovative technology owing to its high-efficiency, low-energy consumption, and environmental friendliness. However, the manufacturing process of the magnetocaloric materials is an obstacle to the effective application of those materials on refrigeration systems. In this work, we present a magnetic characterization of the Gd5.09Ge2.03Si1.88.alloy, analyzing the as-cast bulk and the sintered tablets after some heat treatments. The study of powder metallurgy parameters such as grain size, compacting pressure and sintering process has showed results comparable to the as-cast alloy, which presents \u0394ST=\u221218/kgK.", "Fe50Co50 thin films with thickness of 30 and 4nm have been produced by rf sputtering on glass substrates, and their surface has been observed with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and magnetic force microscopy (MFM); MFM images reveal a non-null component of the magnetization perpendicular to the film plane. Selected samples have been annealed in vacuum at temperatures of 300 and 350\u00b0C for times between 20 and 120min, under a static magnetic field of 100Oe. DC hysteresis loops have been measured with an alternating gradient force magnetometer (AGFM) along the direction of the field applied during annealing and orthogonally to it. Samples with a thickness of 4nm display lower coercive fields with respect to the 30nm thick ones. Longer annealing times affect the development of a harder magnetic phase more oriented off the film plane. The field applied during annealing induces a moderate magnetic anisotropy only on 30nm thick films.", "The geometry effect on the bulk magnetic properties of MnZn ferrite toroidal cores produced by the ceramic method was investigated. The MnZn ferrite powder was pressed at two different toroidal sizes and sintered, under controlled atmosphere at different temperatures. The MnZn ferrites cores were characterized according to their magnetic losses, electrical resistivity, initial permeability and Curie temperature. The total loss (200mT, 100kHz) in the small cores S (aspect ratio (AR)=2.84) is lower compared with the total loss in the large cores L (AR=0.79). These results show an agreement with the geometry effect observed on electrical steels.", "Sensors with cores, yokes or field concentrators made of bulk magnetic material are more sensitive and stable than thin-film sensors. Non-linearity and temperature dependence of sensitivity is often suppressed by a feedback. The common problem of these sensors is remanence, cross-field sensitivity and temperature stability of offset. The long-time effort to miniaturize the fluxgates led only to a few practical designs. For flat sensors (either pcb or CMOS) the core etched from amorphous tape gives better properties then electrodeposited or sputtered core. We compare traditional miniature fluxgates using wire cores based on longitudinal fluxgate effect with sensors using transverse fluxgate effect and GMI effect. Well-designed field concentrators or yokes can improve the parameters of any magnetic sensor. The achievable stable amplification factor is 10\u2013100. Having a means to demagnetize the field concentrator is desirable. Overview of magnetic sensors for mechanical quantities is also given with special focus on torque sensors.", "Hard magnetic Sm2Fe17Nx thin films were prepared by dc magnetron sputtering and subsequent nitrogenation process. The results show that the sputtering parameters determine the film composition, which determines the crystal structure and magnetic properties. When the gas pressure varies from 1.2 to 2.1Pa and power varies from 40 to 60W, higher Sm content (>11.3at%) is obtained, giving rise to improved coercivity HC and remanence ratio MR/MS. The optimal HC of 2127.8Oe and MR/MS of 0.53 are obtained when the gas pressure and power reach 1.2Pa and 50W, respectively. In addition, it is found that the pure single Sm2Fe17 phase can be observed when the ratio of Fe/Sm exceeds 7.1 by controlling the sputtering parameters to adjust the composition.", "Ru/CoPtCr-SiO2 bilayer prepared at 4 and 26mTorr of Ar gas pressure for the deposition of Ru and CoPtCr-SiO2 layers, respectively, exhibits better magnetic properties suitable for perpendicular magnetic recording media when they are deposited at room temperature on a Pt seed layer prepared at 450\u00b0C. The Ru-O seed layer fabricated by a reactive sputtering method improves the Ru (001) texture deposited on a Ru-O layer. The Ru-O/Ru hybrid type of underlayer causes the improvement of the c-axis orientation of CoPtCr crystallites in the CoPtCr-SiO2 layer deposited on it. Fine granulation of magnetic grains in the CoPtCr-SiO2 layer is also attained when they are deposited on the Aramid type of flexible tape substrates.", "The crystal structure and magnetic properties of the hard magnetic Sm2(Fe1\u2212xCox)17N\u03b4 thin films prepared by dc magnetron sputtering and subsequent nitrogenation process were investigated. It is found that the N content and crystal structure determine the non-monotonic dependence of the coercivity HC on nitriding temperature for the films with x=0. With nitriding temperature exceeding 300\u00b0C, N atoms can enter the Sm2Fe17 phase and the N content increases with increasing nitriding temperature, which leads to an increased coercivity. However, the maximum value of the HC is observed at 400\u00b0C. The \u03b1-Fe soft phase appears with nitriding temperature further increasing to 500\u00b0C, which is responsible for the decreased HC. When x is between 0 and 0.36, the films exhibit single Th2Zn17-type structure. Co atoms are found to go into the lattice of the 2:17 phase, generating an enhanced exchange coupling interaction between the nano-grains, which is responsible for the improved hard magnetic properties of the films with Co substitution at a certain range. Especially, the optimal value of the coercivity HC and remanence ratio MR/MS reaches 4.0kOe and 0.70 for the films with x=0.17 and 0.36, respectively.", "Z-type ferrites doped with La3+, Ba3\u2212xLaxCo2Fe24O41 (x=0.00\u20130.30), were prepared by sol\u2013gel method. The effect of the substitution La3+ rare-earth ions for Ba2+ ions on the microstructure, complex permeability, permittivity and microwave absorption of the samples was investigated. The results show that the major phase of the ferrites changed to Z-phase when sintering temperature was 1250\u00b0C for 5h. With the increase of the substitution ratio of La3+ ions from 0.0 to 0.3, the lattice parameters a and c increased gradually, which resulted in the change of the particle shape and size. The data of magnetism showed that the addition of La3+ ions make the ferrite a better soft magnetic material due to increase of magnetization (\u03c3s) and decrease of coercivity (Hc). The La3+ ions doped in the ferrite not only improved complex permeability and complex permittivity, but also microwave absorbency.", "Nickel\u2013zinc ferrite materials containing different Bi2O3 concentrations have been prepared by the conventional ceramic technique. Micrographs have clearly revealed that the Bi2O3 additive promoted grain growth. When the Bi2O3 content reached 0.15wt%, a dual microstructure with both small grains (<5\u03bcm) and some extremely large grains (>50\u03bcm) appeared. With higher Bi2O3 content, the samples exhibited a very large average grain size of more than 30\u03bcm. The initial permeability gradually decreased with increasing Bi2O3 content. When the Bi2O3 content exceeded 0.15wt%, the permeability gradually decreased with frequency due to the low-frequency resonance induced by the large grain size. Neither the sintering density nor the saturation magnetization was obviously influenced by the Bi2O3 content or microstructure of the samples. However, power loss (Pcv) characteristics were evidently influenced. At low flux density, the sample with 0.10wt% Bi2O3, which was characterized by an average grain size of 3\u20134\u03bcm and few closed pores, displayed the lowest Pcv, irrespective of frequency. When the flux density was equal to or greater than the critical value of 40mT, the sample with 0.20wt% Bi2O3, which had the largest average grain size, displayed the lowest Pcv.", "Low-temperature-fired NiCuZn ferrites with the formula Ni0.45Cu0.2Zn0.35Fe2\u2212xO4\u22123/2x with x values ranging from 0.00 to 0.25 in steps of 0.05 and sintered at 900\u00b0C have been investigated in the present work. It was found that the content of Fe-deficiency could obviously influence the microstructure, sintering behavior, saturation magnetization, permeability and permittivity spectra properties of the ferrites. The variations were much different from those of the high-temperature-fired NiZn ferrites. And the corresponding mechanisms involved were discussed in detail. All-around consideration, the NiCuZn ferrite with 0.10 Fe-deficiency in composition had the best performances on sintering behavior and electromagnetic properties.", "The soft magnetic properties of the substrate/[non-buffer or buffer Ta]/[permalloy (Ni80Fe20) or conetic (Ni77Fe14Cu5Mo4)]/Ta prepared by ion beam sputter deposition are investigated. The value of the surface resistance of the conetic film is twice as high as that of the permalloy film. The value of the coercivity and magnetic susceptibility of the conetic film decreased by 25% and doubled relative to that of the permalloy film. The coercivity, with a value of 0.12Oe, and the magnetic susceptibility, with a value of 1.2\u00d7104 for the conetic film, are suitable for soft magnetic biosensor applications.", "Multi-doped YIG ferrites {Y1.7Gd0.5Ca0.8}[Fe2\u2212xInx](Fe2.15V0.4Mn0.05Al0.4)O12 (x=0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9) with low saturation magnetizations (4\u03c0Ms=400\u2013600G at 298K) were prepared by a conventional ceramic technology and the effects of In3+-substitution on their structures and magnetic properties were systematically investigated using XRD, SEM and VSM. It has been found that as-synthesized powders and sintered ferrites showed a single-phase of garnet structure with a cell parameter (a) that increased linearly with increase in In3+ concentration from x=0 up to 0.9. Apparent relative densities of sintered samples were all over 98%, but no remarkable influences of In3+-substitution were observed by SEM on the refinement of crystal grains and the enhancement of sintering of ferrites. In addition, the Curie temperature Tc decreased almost linearly as In3+concentration increased, while the corresponding saturation magnetization at room temperature presented a variation characterized by a gradual increase first and then a rapid plunge. On the basis of quantitative analysis of XRD data and the theory on super-exchange interactions, it has been established that the incorporated In3+ ions via doping were exclusively located at the sites with octahedral coordinations in the crystal structure and the aforementioned magnetic properties can be simply attributed to weakening super-exchange interactions between neighboring magnetic ions through oxygen ions due to the \u201cdilution effect\u201d of added non-magnetic In3+ ions.", "This study describes an attempt to produce NdFeB magnets that are insensitive to the sintering temperature. It was found that addition of Zr to NdFeB magnets significantly augmented the thermal stability of this magnetic material during sintering at high temperature even at industrial scale. The best sintered magnets were produced by jet-milling the powder (to achieve an average 3.4\u03bcm particle size), and then aligned, pressed and sintered under argon at 1100\u00b0C for 3h followed by appropriate heat treatment. The magnetic properties of the resulting magnets were: (BH)m=403.8kJm\u22123 (\u00b14.7kJm\u22123), Br=1430mT (\u00b19mT) and iHc=907kAm\u22121 (\u00b112kAm\u22121). Large grain growth, in excess of 100\u03bcm in the Zr-free magnets, was observed during sintering at 1100\u00b0C. This did not occur in the presence of Zr. These observations imply that the sensitivity of this class of magnets to high sintering temperatures is greatly reduced by Zr addition. Corrosion resistance of NdFeB was therefore significantly improved by the addition of small amounts of Zr.", "[Co83Fe17/Au/Co/Au]N sputter deposited multilayers displaying a giant magnetoresistance have been investigated. Complementary magnetic measurements were conducted in order to characterize a spin reorientation transition in Co83Fe17 layers sandwiched between Au spacers. The transition from a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy to easy-plane one takes place at the thickness of about 1nm.", "Magneto-structural properties of films of diluted ferromagnetic alloys NixCu1\u2212x in the concentration range 0.7<x<1.0 are studied experimentally. Films deposited by magnetron sputtering show partial phase separation, as evidenced by structural analysis and ferromagnetic resonance measurements. The phase diagram of the NixCu1\u2212x bulk system is obtained using numerical theoretical analysis of the electronic structure, taking into account the interatomic exchange interactions. The results confirm the experimentally found partial phase separation, explain it as magnetic in origin, and indicate an additional metastable region connected with the ferromagnetic transition in the system.", "Vacuum-annealing was carried out on the pure indium oxide films deposited on Si (100) substrates by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering. Oxygen-deficiency states and room temperature d0 ferromagnetism were both detected in the as-grown and vacuum-annealed films. With more oxygen vacancies appeared through vacuum-annealing, the saturation magnetization increased rapidly from 0.5 to 5.5emu/cm3. The connection between the highly oxygen-deficiency states and the strong magnetic moment suggests that oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in mediating the ferromagnetism in In2O3 films. We think that this d0 ferromagnetism mainly stems from V 0 + and oxygen vacancy clusters in the interfaces or grain boundaries.", "A 50\u03bcm Al\u2013Cr coating on NdFeB sintered magnets was prepared through dipping in solution, shaking dry and heating at 300\u00b0C. The morphology and composition of the Al\u2013Cr coating were investigated with scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer and X-ray diffraction. The corrosion resistance of NdFeB sintered magnets with and without the Al\u2013Cr coating was analyzed by normal salt spray, polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The magnetic properties were measured with a hysteresis loop tracer. The results show that the Al\u2013Cr coating forms an overlapping structure and Al flakes lie nearly parallel to the substrate, which improves the anticorrosion and increases normal salt spray test from 10 to 100h. The corrosion potential of NdFeB sintered magnets with and without the Al\u2013Cr coating moves positively from \u22120.67 to \u22120.48V, which is in accordance with Nyquist and Bode plots. The Al\u2013Cr coating has little influence on the magnetic properties of the NdFeB sintered magnets.", "FePt\u2013Si\u2013N films consisting of FePt nanoparticles embedded in Si\u2013N matrix were fabricated on Si(100) substrates by dc reactive magnetron sputtering followed by vacuum annealing. The effects of film thickness, Fe/Pt atomic ratio, and Si, N additions on the structure and magnetic properties were investigated. Perpendicular orientation can be obtained in the film with small thickness. Fe content also has an important effect on the film orientation. The ordering temperature for FePt\u2013Si\u2013N films is 100\u00b0C higher than that of FePt films. Both FePt and FePt\u2013Si\u2013N films have the highest coercivity at Fe content of 55at%. Doping Si and N can improve the coercivity of FePt film through weakening the exchange coupling and reducing the grain size. To achieve high coercivity in FePt\u2013Si\u2013N film, the Si/N atomic ratio has to be well controlled.", "Nanoparticle-FePt/Fe bilayer thin films with different Fe layer thicknesses and [nanoparticle-FePt/Fe]n multilayer thin films with various periods were fabricated by DC magnetron sputtering. Their structures and magnetic properties (energy product and exchange coupling) were investigated by X-ray diffraction technique and vibrating sample magnetometer, respectively. The results show that coercivities of FePt/Fe bilayer films are dropped from 10.7kOe to 0.53kOe with increasing Fe soft magnetic layer thickness, due to the interconnecting of FePt nano-particles by Fe-rich soft magnetic phase and decreasing of the ordering degree of L10-FePt phase. The critical Fe layer thickness changing the annealed film from granular to continuous microstructure is about 4nm. For multilayer [FePt/Fe]n films, both ordering degree of L10-FePt phase and magnetic properties are improved with the number of layer periods. Moreover, a maximum energy products as high as 21.65MGOe is obtained in the [FePt/Fe]5 multilayer film. The enhancement of saturation magnetization and energy products can be ascribed to the high ordering degree of FePt phase as well as the strong exchange coupling among L10-FePt hard magnetic phase and Fe-rich soft magnetic phase.", "Nanocrystalline Ni0.94Co0.03Mn0.04Cu0.03Fe1.96\u2212xAlxO4 (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9) were synthesized using the microwave hydrothermal method at 160\u00b0C/40min. The synthesized powders were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR). The nanopowders were densified using microwave sintering method at 950\u00b0C/30min. The prepared samples were characterized using XRD and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The substitution of nonmagnetic Al3+ ions in place of magnetic Fe3+ ions results decrease of the density and lattice constant. An increase in dc resistivity and reduction in the initial permeability, saturation magnetization (Ms) and Curie temperature (TC) has been observed with a substitution of Al3+ ions. High dc resistivity and low dielectric, magnetic losses combined with an excellent temperature stability of magnetization (4\u03c0Ms) observed in the present ferrites can be explored for the fabrication of microwave device such as circulators, phase shifters etc.", "The nanometer titania particles enhanced epoxy resin composite coatings were prepared on the sintered NdFeB permanent magnets by cathodic electrophoretic deposition. The effects of titania particle concentrations on the microstructure and properties of the epoxy coatings were investigated by surface and cross-sectional morphologies observation, surface roughness and microhardness measurement, H2SO4 solution immersion test, neutral salt spray test and magnetic properties measurement. The results showed that the thickness of epoxy coatings with and without the titania particles addition was about 40\u03bcm. The titania particles could be uniformly dispersed and embedded in the epoxy matrix if the titania particles concentration was lower than 40g/l. With increasing titania particle concentrations, the number of the particles embedded in the epoxy matrix increased and the surface roughness and microhardness of the composite coatings increased. At the same time, the weight loss of the coated samples immersed in H2SO4 solution decreased and the neutral salt spray time of the coated samples prolonged. It could be concluded that the titania particles did not change the thickness of the epoxy coatings and did not deteriorate the magnetic properties of NdFeB substrates, but could greatly improve the microhardness and corrosion resistance of the epoxy coatings.", "Spintronics requires the development of magnetic thin film structures having a wide range of magnetic properties. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is a well understood experimental technique that has proven to be an invaluable tool to probe the static and dynamic magnetic properties of ultrathin films, multilayer nanostructures, and superlattices. In order to achieve a full characterization of thin film materials, one needs to carry out FMR measurements at a wide range of microwave frequencies. In this paper, we show that one does not have to use a broadband vector network analyzer; similar performance can be achieved by using a broadband microwave signal generator, a coplanar waveguide, and a broadband microwave detector. To obtain a good signal to noise ratio, one needs to employ a modulation technique in order to use lock-in detection; in this paper, we use low frequency external field modulation (105Hz) and microwave power amplitude pulse modulation (10kHz). The sensitivity and the performance of this broadband microwave system is demonstrated on two types of samples: molecular beam epitaxy grown single crystal GaAs(001)/Fe/Au and sputter deposited textured Si(111)/Ta/Ru/Co/Ru superlattice structures. The samples were mounted on a coplanar waveguide, allowing one a broadband measurement, ~0.1\u201350GHz, of DC field swept FMR signals. The results are compared to traditional field swept, field modulated measurements in microwave cavity resonators. Despite the fact that the FMR signal can be very different from that obtained by standard microwave cavities, we show that the analysis of the FMR signal is fairly simple using an admixture of the in-phase and out-of-phase components of rf susceptibility and that the resulting fitted magnetic parameters are in excellent agreement. Additionally, we demonstrate that microwave power amplitude pulse modulation can be used to greatly speed up data collection times, especially for very weak and broad FMR signals.", "Ba2ZnCuFe12O22 (ZnCuY) barium ferrites were prepared using a sol\u2013gel auto combustion method. Mixing the ferrite particles with various sintering temperature from 900 to 1200\u00b0C, ferrite/silicone composite were fabricated. The phase structures, morphologies, magnetic and microwave properties were investigated for the as-prepared samples and the composites. The composites show considerable large permeability with \u00b5\u20320 of 4.8 and \u00b5\u2033max of 1.7 at resonance frequency of 2.4GHz. Also, they have good microwave attenuation properties with the percentage bandwidth of 106% for RL<\u221210dB in a frequency range of 3\u201310GHz with thickness of only 3.7mm. Therefore, ZnCuY composites could be potential candidates for microwave attenuation applications.", "A series of Al substituted MgCuZn ferrite powders with composition Mg0.3Cu0.2Zn0.52AlxFe1.98\u2212xO3.99 (0.00\u2264x\u22640.06) have been synthesized with nano-sized precursor powders through the nitrate\u2013citrate auto-combustion route. These powders were calcined, compacted and sintered at 900\u00b0C for 4h. X-ray diffraction patterns show the formation of cubic spinel structure. Infrared spectra indicate two fundamental absorption bands corresponding to the tetrahedral and octahedral complexes, respectively. A significant increase in density and grain size is observed with increasing Al content. The room temperature saturation magnetization increases for x=0.015 and then decreases for further increase in Al substitution. The initial permeability increases with the Al content attributed to the increase in the grain size and density. Curie temperature is found to be dependent on the Al concentration and it decreases due to decrease in the number of super-exchange interactions between Fe3+ ions in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites.", "Magnetic films and multilayers are the focus of much attention motivated mainly by their wide range of applications, such as magnetic data storage devices and sensors. The magnetic multilayer structures are normally prepared through physical means of deposition, as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or sputtering. However, there are already examples of materials produced by electrochemical routes, which share with the other deposition techniques a high sensitivity of magnetic and transport properties of the samples on their crystallographic and chemical structure. In addition, electrochemical deposition allows growing structures with high aspect ratio, which are not possible to obtain by MBE deposition followed by lithographic processes. The present work investigates the Co/Ni bilayered nanocrystalline films produced through the temperature-elevated electrochemical deposition, and modified by annealing carried out also under an external magnetic field. The results indicate an increase of the coercive field of deposited Co/Ni bilayers, when the electrodeposition process was conducted under magnetic field of 1T. The annealing processing caused further remarkable increase of the coercive field of as-prepared bilayers that has been preserved under magnetic annealing conditions. The magnetic properties are discussed in terms of samples microstructure. In as-prepared samples the in-plane magnetization was observed, while high temperature treatment, causing microstructural changes in the film, resulted also in appearance of a small component of magnetization oriented perpendicularly to the films\u2019 plane that could have been observed by MFM analysis. The induced perpendicular magnetization component in the post-annealed samples was a result of the magnetic field applied in the perpendicular direction to the samples\u2019 surface during annealing treatment.", "Curie temperature of Co0.7\u2212xNixMn0.3Fe2O4 (with X=0.00, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15) synthesized by the double sintering ceramic method, was recorded by, Lorria Sinha (TCL), dc resistivity (TCR) and dielectric measurement (TCD). Curie temperatures obtained by three various methods are in good agreement with each other. Curie temperature measurements exhibit anomalous increasing trend with increasing nickel content for all the compositions. Three - sublattice model is used to elucidate anomalous behavior as, Neels two - sublattice model fails to explain increase in Curie temperature, even after the replacement of Co2+ ions (3\u00b5B) by Ni2+ ions (2\u00b5B). Decrease in lattice constant and interionic distances can be probably originated by strengthening of A\u2013B interaction. Enhancement in Curie temperature is observed due to the strengthening of A\u2013B interaction. Values of magnetic moments and interaction between them are not the only reasons for enhancement of Tc but change in their orientation with temperature is also important and therefore analysis of Curie temperature is given on basis of anisotropic energy.", "The potential of spark plasma sintering (SPS) in combination with rapid thermal annealing (RTA) for the processing of Mn\u2013Al nanostructured magnets is explored in this study. Ferromagnetic \u03b1-Mn alloy powders were processed by high-energy ball milling using Mn (56at%) and Al (44at%) as constituent metal elements. The alloying action between Mn and Al due to intensive milling was studied by X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscope; while the phase transformation kinetics was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. The evolution of ferromagnetic properties in the as-milled powders was studied by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Among the Mn\u2013Al alloy powders collected at various milling intervals, the 25h milled Mn\u2013Al powders showed a good combination of coercivity, Hc (11.3kA/m) and saturation magnetization, Ms (5.0A/m2/kg); accordingly, these powders were chosen for SPS. The SPS experiments were conducted at different temperatures: 773, 873 and 973K and its effect on the density, phase composition and magnetic properties of the Mn\u2013Al bulk samples were investigated. Upon increasing the SPS temperature from 773 to 973K, the bulk density was found to increase from 3.6 to 4.0g/cm3. The occurrence of equilibrium \u03b2-phase with significant amount of \u03b32-phase was obvious at all the SPS temperatures; however, crystallization of some amount of \u03c4-phase was evident at 973K. Irrespective of the SPS temperatures, all the samples demonstrated soft magnetic behavior with Hc and Ms values similar to those obtained for the 25h milled powders. The magnetic properties of the SPSed samples were significantly improved upon subjecting them to RTA at 1100K. Through the RTA process, Hc values of 75, 174 and 194kA/m and Ms values of 19, 21 and 28A/m2/kg were achieved for the samples SPSed at 773, 873 and 973K, respectively. The possible reasons for the observed improvement in the magnetic properties of the SPSed samples due to RTA in correlation with their phase composition and microstructure were analyzed and discussed.", "We have investigated the synthesis conditions, and the magnetic properties of the Cu2U-type hexagonal ferrite, Ba4Cu2Fe36O60. The Cu2U-type hexaferrite was synthesized at the sintering temperature of 1050\u00b0C with the initial composition of Ba4.4Cu2Fe37.6O62.8 (Cu2U+0.2T-block). The saturation magnetizations at 300K and 5K are 46.8Am2/kg and 65.0Am2/kg, respectively. The Curie temperature is 420\u00b0C which is lower than that of the M-type ferrite (450\u00b0C) but higher than that of the Cu2Y-type ferrite (320\u00b0C). The amount of the nonmagnetic impurity in this sample is estimated to be about 10wt% by the electron probe micro analysis. We estimated the expected saturation magnetization to be 65.2Am2/kg, by assuming the model of a N\u00e9el-type ferrimagnetic structure and the reduction of magnetization by the 10wt% nonmagnetic impurity. This is consistent with the observed magnetization of 65.0Am2/kg at 5K.", "In this work, the influence of obliquely sputtered Cu underlayer of 10nm on the magnetic properties of normally sputtered Permalloy thin films with different thicknesses from 10nm to 150nm has been investigated. It has been found that the samples with the Permalloy layer thickness ranging from 10nm to 70nm exhibit a good in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and the increase of the film thickness leads to a decrease of the anisotropy field and the natural resonance frequency. The critical Permalloy layer thickness for stripe domain initiation of these films is about 80nm, which is thinner than that of obliquely sputtered Permalloy thin films without an underlayer. The characteristic shapes of hysteresis loops which can be called \"transcritical\" are observed above the critical thickness. The condition and mechanism of appearing stripe domain structure were discussed and it has been found that the frequency response of permeability of the anisotropic films shows the characteristics of multi-peak resonance.", "Magnetic performance of Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B sintered magnets, especially the coercivity is highly sensitive to microstructures extrinsically. To enhance coercivity of the near-stoichiometric Nd2Fe14B magnet (Nd, Pr)12.5FebalB6.1 (at%), the microstructure is optimized by varying sintering condition. At lower sintering temperatures, full densification cannot be reached even prolonging the sintering time, the coupling between adjacent 2:14:1 phase grains results in a low coercivity. At higher sintering temperatures, the grains of 2:14:1 phase grow up quickly, also deteriorating the coercivity. At an optimum sintering temperature of 1050\u00b0C, the magnet reaches a full densification with most 2:14:1 phase grains of 4\u20135\u03bcm, showing a high coercivity of 16.4kOe. The formation of smooth and continuous grain boundary RE-rich phase reduces the magnetic interactions and the grain refinement hinders nucleation of reversed domains at low fields, respectively.", "The FePt films with thickness of 4\u221210nm were deposited on MoC/CrRu/glass at substrate temperature ranged from 260 to 410\u00b0C by using magnetron sputtering and strong (001) textured FePt films were obtained at 380\u00b0C and 410\u00b0C. The multi-functional MoC conductive intermediate layer was used to resist the Cr diffusion and promote the epitaxial growth of the (001) textured FePt film which shows perpendicular magnetization and a linear-like in-plane magnetic loop. The out-of plane coercivity and shape of demagnetization curve were dominated by the ordering degree and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy which were increased with deposited temperature. The FePt film deposited at 290\u00b0C shows continuous morphology and change to interconnected structure at 350\u00b0C and finally form the island like structure at 380\u00b0C and 410\u00b0C. Each island contains many FePt grains and the smaller grains size was 12.2nm which obtained at 5nm thick FePt film. Perpendicular anisotropy of 1.1\u00d7107erg/cm3 and coercivity of 8.2kOe have been demonstrated in 7nm thick FePt film.", "Magneto-dielectric materials with matched permeability and permittivity have significant advantages for miniaturization and efficiency improvement of antennas. In this study, we adopted the Z-type hexaferrites in series (Ba0.5Sr0.5)3Co2Fe24O41+xSnO2 (where x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6wt%) to produce the magneto-dielectric material. It was found that moderate SnO2 could obviously enhance mass transfer and densification of the ferrites, while there was no significant increase in grain size, which favored to obtain low magnetic and dielectric losses. However, excessive SnO2 led to the appearance of Co2W phase and slight decrease of sintered density. The samples with 0.1 and 0.2wt% SnO2 could obtain relatively high refractive index with real permeability and permittivity around 15. And the former presented the lowest magnetic and dielectric losses; the latter presented the best matched permeability and permittivity. Both of them are suitable for applications of antenna miniaturization between 3 and 300MHz (HF and VHF bands).", "The sintering behavior, microstructure and permeability of Co/Ti-substituted M-type hexagonal ferrites BaCoxTixFe12\u22122xO19 (1.0\u2264x\u22641.4) was studied for applications as multilayer inductors in the high-frequency range up to 2GHz. Single-phase M-type ferrites were obtained after calcination at 1000\u00b0C. The saturation magnetization and coercivity decrease with x and hysteresis measurements illustrate a gradual transition of the anisotropy from uniaxial to planar. Addition of 5wt% of a BBSZ glass allows densification at 900\u00b0C through liquid-phase sintering. The permeability of samples sintered at 900\u00b0C increases with the Co/Ti substitution and reaches its maximum of \u00b5\u2032=16 at 1MHz at x=1.3 with a resonance frequency fr\u22651GHz. Monolithic ferrite multilayer inductors were fabricated with printed Ag coil patterns by co-firing at 900\u00b0C. It is shown that Co/Ti-substituted hexagonal M-type ferrite is an excellent material for the high-frequency multilayer inductors.", "The goal of this paper was to investigate the effect of the addition of nano-silica (<20nm) and the sintering temperature on the magneto-dielectric properties of Li0.30Zn0.4Fe2.30O4 ferrites produced by the conventional method in various temperatures (298\u2013673K) and frequencies (1KHz\u20134MHz). The density and microstructural results revealed that density and grain growth rate were sensitive to the sintering temperature and nano-SiO2 content. At low amounts of SiO2 (2wt%), an increase in nano-SiO2 content increased the density and grain growth rate. SiO2 contents Higher than 2wt% caused a decrease in the grain size of samples. Moreover, the sample with the highest grain size showed the highest permeability and the lowest magnetic loss. On the other hand, \u03b5\u2032 showed a dispersive behavior with frequency for all samples. The frequency dependence of tan\u03b4 showed a resonance peak. It was observed that \u03b5\u2032 and tan\u03b4 were increased with the increase in the temperature. Furthermore, the variation of magneto-dielectric properties as a function of frequency were explained according to Koops' theory and electron hopping between the Fe+2 and Fe+3 ions.", "The temperature dependence of the coercive force decrease ratio for aligned magnets was investigated from room temperature (296K) to 473K. The temperature properties of the angular dependence of the coercive force were also measured from room temperature to 413K, for comparison against the coercive force decrease ratio. From the temperature dependence of the coercive force decrease ratio of magnets with different alignment, it was found that the coercive force decrease ratio decreased as temperature increased until becoming close to the calculation results that were obtained from the Gaussian distribution for Nd2Fe14B grain alignment and from the postulation that every grain follows the Kondorskii law or the 1/cos\u03b8 law. When we compared the angle of the magnetization reverse area obtained from these calculation results and the angle of the reverse magnetization area calculated from the experimental data of the coercive force decrease ratio, it was found that this latter expanded to 30\u00b0 for Nd13.48B5.76Co0.55Febal. having 0.95 alignment, at room temperature, from 14\u00b0 that was the calculated angle obtained from the Gaussian distribution and the Kondorskii law. The angular dependence of coercive force of this magnet at room temperature agrees well with the calculation, when \u03c3=31\u00b0, which is 30\u00b0 for the reversed magnetization area, is applied as the standard deviation of Nd2Fe14B grain alignment distribution. For Nd12.75Dy0.84B5.81Co0.55Febal. with 0.96 for alignment, the reverse magnetization area also expanded to 36\u00b0 and agreed well with the calculation result applied \u03c3=44\u00b0, which has 36\u00b0 for the reverse magnetization area. It was also found that, as temperature increased, the angle of the reverse magnetization area obtained from the experimental data shrunk towards the calculated angle. When we apply these results to the temperature properties of the angular dependence of the coercive force, it seems that the calculated angular dependence of the coercive force can qualitatively and reasonably explain these temperature properties. These results strongly suggest that the magnetic domain walls are strongly pinned at tilted grains. It also suggests that, when such magnetic domain walls are de-pinned from their pinning sites, they leap through several grains with weak pinning force, which determines the coercive force.", "The polycrystalline compounds of La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 (S0C1) and La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (S1C0) were prepared using the citric\u2013gel method. With the resultant nanoparticle powders having crystallite size of 22.51nm from S0C1 and 27.39nm from S1C0, the 0.875(S0C1)0.125(S1C0) composition was sintered at different temperatures: SC. 4-1 (at 700\u00b0C), SC. 4-2 (at 900\u00b0C), SC. 4-3 (at 1100\u00b0C) and SC. 4-4 (at 1300\u00b0C). XRD data were analyzed by Rietveld refinement technique. The two S0C1 and S1C0 mother compounds were found to crystallize in the rhombohedral and orthorhombic structure, respectively. The compounds sintered at 700\u00b0C (SC. 4-1) and 900\u00b0C (SC. 4-2) were found to present the two rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases corresponding to the mother compounds, which indicates that no interfacial reaction occurs. However, when augmenting the sintering temperature, the formation of the 0.875(S0C1)0.125(S1C0) new phase was observed. These observations were confirmed from the magnetization study, which revealed that the SC. 4-1 and SC. 4-2 compounds present two magnetic transitions temperature corresponding to the two mother compounds. For higher sintering temperature (1100 and 1300\u00b0C), we have noted the presence of a new magnetic transition corresponding to the composition 0.875(S0C1)0.125(S1C0) compound. The variation of the M(T) curves were discussed in terms of the orthorhombic distortion \u03c32(Mn\u2013O).", "FePt films were prepared by magnetron sputtering deposition using Ar as the sputtering gas under different working pressures (0.3\u20130.7Pa). The effect of sputtering gas pressure on the microstructure, magnetic, and magnetoresistance properties has been investigated. The results show that the crystallization of FePt films is strongly dependent on the Ar sputter pressure. With the decrease of Ar working pressures, the fct phase forms and the coercivity (Hc) of FePt films rises under the same annealing temperature. As a result, the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) increases by 20% at the room temperature. At 0.7Pa, the anisotropy magnetoresistance (AMR) can be observed clearly at a low field. However, as the Ar pressure decreases, the increase of GMR leads to a degradation of AMR effect. We believe that the improvement of GMR effect results from the increase of magnetic anisotropy and spin polarization in the process of transformation from the soft magnetic fcc phase to the hard magnetic fct phase.", "Commercial NdFeB powders mixed with DyHx nanoparticles are hot pressed and hot deformed into anisotropic magnets by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). The hot deformed magnet exhibits strong c-axis crystallographic texture. The coercivity of the magnet doped with 1.0wt% DyHx is increased by 66.7%, compared with the magnet without DyHx, while the remanence decreases only by 3%. TEM observation shows that there exists a continuous (Nd,Dy)2Fe14B layer between Nd-rich phase and NdFeB main phase.", "The effect of bath PH value on formation, microstructure and corrosion resistance of the phosphate chemical conversion (PCC) coatings as well as the effect on the magnetic property of the magnets is investigated in this paper. The results show that the coating mass and thickness increase with the decrease of the bath PH value. Scanning electron microscopy observation demonstrates that the PCC coatings are in a blocky structure with different grain size. Transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffractometer tests reveal the coatings are polycomponent and are mainly composed of neodymium phosphate hydrate and praseodymium phosphate hydrate. The electrochemical analysis and static immersion corrosion test show the corrosion resistance of the PCC coatings prepared at bath PH value of 0.52 is worst. Afterwards the corrosion resistance increases first and then decreases with the increasing of the bath PH values. The magnetic properties of all the samples with PCC treatment are decreased. The biggest loss is occurred when the bath PH value is 0.52. Taken together, the optimum PH range of 1.00\u20131.50 for the phosphate solution has been determined.", "(Mg, Ca, Ba)-ferrite magnetic nanoparticles were successfully synthesized through modifying the atomic ratio of polysaccharide and chelating agent at an optimal sintering temperature. In the process, the polysaccharide plays an important role in drastically shrinking the precursor during the gel drying process. In the metal-complex structure, M2+ ion active sites were coordinated by \u2212OH of the water molecules except for EDTA anions. The MFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles exhibited enhanced magnetic properties when compared with nano-MFe2O4 of similar particle size synthesized by other synthesis route reported in the literature. In particular, the sintering temperature improves the crystallinity and increases the hysteresis loop squareness ratio of (Mg, Ca, Ba)-ferrite nanoparticles significantly.", "Spinel ferrites with chemical formula CuPryFe2-yO4(y=0.0,0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08,0.10) were synthesized using sol-gel technique. The sintered powder characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). X-ray Diffraction analysis showed that the samples with concentration (y=0.0\u20130.06) have single spinel phase and the samples with concentration at y=0.08\u20130.10 have secondary phase (ortho ferrite phase) along spinel phase. The Lattice constant a increased with the substitution of Praseodymium (Pr) ions. The crystallite size calculated from Scherre's formula is found in the range of 53\u201337nm. It is observed that DC resistivity and activation energy enhances with the substitution of Pr. The dc resistivity decreased with the increase in temperature. The conduction below Curie temperature (Tc) is due to hopping of electrons and holes, whereas, above Curie temperature it is due to polaron hopping. The decrease in Tc with increasing Pr constant may be due to the fact that Pr\u2013Fe interactions on the B sites are weaker than Fe\u2013Fe interaction. The saturation magnetization (Ms) and remanence (Mr) decreased where as coercivity (Hc) has been increased with the increase of Pr content. The measured parameters suggest that these materials are potential candidates for high frequency applications.", "Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nano ferrite particles have been prepared by mechanical alloying via high energy ball milling and sintered at different temperatures from 700\u00b0C to 1000\u00b0C. Spinel structure is confirmed from the analysis of XRD data. Rietveld refinement method is employed to refine the XRD powder data and the structural parameters are calculated from the refinement. Small amount of hematite phase is found in all samples. The SEM, EDAX and XRF analysis reveals respectively the morphology, stoichiometric composition and purity of the powder samples. Using Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) the values of the bond strength between various sites interactions in ferrites are evaluated and compared with theoretical predictions of strengthening/weakening of various sites interactions from the values of interionic distances and interionic bond angles. Ferromagnetic nature of the samples is confirmed from the vibrating sample magnetometer study. The obtained low saturation magnetization values are attributed to presence of second phase. The optical band gap energy of the samples was determined by using UV\u2013VIS techniques.", "The shape and magneto-crystalline anisotropies of 10nm thick Co sputtered films have shown to be dependent on the oblique deposition angle (\u03b1i), the angular velocity of the substrate-holder (\u03c9S) and the applied magnetic field (H0) during the deposition. Oblique deposition geometry is natural in our sputtering setup, being \u03b1 equal to 22\u00b0 at the edge of 4in. sample-holder and 32\u00b0 at its central part. X-ray diffraction analysis has evidenced a (111) texturized fcc structure for all films. Ferromagnetic resonance has shown that samples prepared under H0 of 250Oe present dominantly the uniaxial HU field contribution independent of the \u03c9S-value, however its magnitude depends on \u03b1i. For a non-magnetic holder, Co films show a mixture of twofold (uniaxial) with fourfold (cubic) in-plane magnetic anisotropies. The fourfold contribution is small and it is not influenced by \u03b1i or \u03c9S within the experimental error, while the dominant twofold contribution, which is governed by the shadowing effect, is reduced for higher \u03c9S and for samples positioned at the center of the sample-holder. In addition, the intrinsic isotropic Gilbert damping dominates the relaxation process, which is followed by anisotropic twofold scattering mechanism due to stripes and defects, interestingly not influenced by the substrate rotation during depositions.", "In this paper, we investigate the demagnetizing effect in ferrite/PZT/ferrite magnetoelectric (ME) trilayer composites consisting of commercial PZT discs bonded by epoxy layers to Ni-Co-Zn ferrite discs made by a reactive Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique. ME voltage coefficients (transversal mode) were measured on ferrite/PZT/ferrite trilayer ME samples with different thicknesses or phase volume ratio in order to highlight the influence of the magnetic field penetration governed by these geometrical parameters. Experimental ME coefficients and voltages were compared to analytical calculations using a quasi-static model. Theoretical demagnetizing factors of two magnetic discs that interact together in parallel magnetic structures were derived from an analytical calculation based on a superposition method. These factors were introduced in ME voltage calculations which take account of the demagnetizing effect. To fit the experimental results, a mechanical coupling factor was also introduced in the theoretical formula. This reflects the differential strain that exists in the ferrite and PZT layers due to shear effects near the edge of the ME samples and within the bonding epoxy layers. From this study, an optimization in magnitude of the ME voltage is obtained. Lastly, an analytical calculation of demagnetizing effect was conducted for layered ME composites containing higher numbers of alternated layers ( n \u2265 5). The advantage of such a structure is then discussed.", "Ordered porous ZrO2 films with pore diameters in the 5\u201345nm range have been prepared on porous anodic alumina substrates using DC-reactive magnetron sputtering of pure Zr targets. A saturation magnetization (MS) value as high as 119emu/cm3 was obtained for the ZrO2 film with pores of 45nm in diameter when the external field was perpendicular to the film surface. The significant out-of-plane saturation magnetization is associated with the porous structure of the film. Experimental and theoretical results showed that the origin of the room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) is closely related to the ordered porous structure and the single charged oxygen vacancies of the films. These findings suggest that porous ZrO2 films are promising to be applied to the spin electronic devices.", "BaTi1.2Co1.2Fe9O19\u2212\u03b4 hexagonal ferrite was prepared by solid state reaction method sintered at 1250\u00b0C, and its structure was examined by XRD and SEM, its magnetic properties were measured by VSM and BH analyzer at different temperature between \u221260\u00b0C and 120\u00b0C. It was found that no power loss minimum can be observed in the power loss versus temperature data when the initial permeability reaches a peak at 60\u00b0C. Magnetic losses analysis indicated that the hysteresis loss is very small at \u221260\u00b0C. The real part of permeability \u03bc\u2032 is a field independent constant in H<500A/m at \u221260\u00b0C, while \u03bc\u2032 shows linear field dependence in the measured field range at 60\u00b0C. The sample shows constant \u03bc\u2032 with very low hysteresis loss in H<500A/m at \u221260\u00b0C, which is consistent with the characteristic of the initial magnetization region, so conclusion is that initial magnetization region expands to high magnetic field with decreasing temperature in BaTi1.2Co1.2Fe9O19\u2212\u03b4 hexagonal ferrite. This characteristic may serve as a new way to achieve low loss soft magnetic materials.", "The high-density FeNi nanoparticle films with strip structures were prepared by electric field-assisted deposition technique. The electric field of 10\u201340kV was applied on the sputtering platform during thin film deposition in order to obtain superior in-plane soft magnetic properties. The dependence of magnetic properties and microwave behavior on electric field was investigated. It is found that these high-density films have magnetically easy-modulated characteristics, especially for the strip-patterned ones. Application of electric field is very effective to obtain stronger in-plane magnetic anisotropy field and higher saturation magnetization simultaneously for our samples. In this case, large permeability and high ferromagnetic resonance frequency are easily achieved when the strip-patterned films are used in a wide gigahertz range. The experimental results indicate that electric field-assisted deposition technique is one of the important and promising manufacture methods to prepare thin film materials with enhanced gigahertz electromagnetic wave properties.", "Two magnets with the same nominal composition of (MM0.3Nd0.7)-Fe-B (Marked as A) and [(La0.27Ce0.53Pr0.03Nd0.17)0.3Nd0.7]-Fe-B (Marked as B) were prepared using traditional powder metallurgical process, respectively. In order to point out the difference between two magnets, the magnetic properties, microstructure and magnetic domain of both magnets were investigated. Both magnets have the same elements, but different raw materials of misch-metal (MM) and La/Ce/Pr/Nd pure metal, which induces different magnetic properties. The magnet A with Br\n                      of 13.1\u202fkGs, Hcj\n                      of 7.6\u202fkOe, (BH)\n                     max of 37.8\u202fMGOe and magnet B with Br\n                      of 13.4\u202fkGs, Hcj\n                      of 5.8\u202fkOe, (BH)\n                     max of 34.5\u202fMGOe are obtained. Although both magnets have the similar Br\n                     , magnet A has higher coercivity than that of magnet B. According to refined results of characteristic X-ray diffraction peaks, there is a hard magnetic main phase with higher magnetic anisotropy field (HA\n                     ) in magnet A and opposite case happens on magnet B. SEM images demonstrate that magnet A has more continuous RE-rich phase and smaller grain size compared to that of magnet B, which contributes to enhancing the coercivity. In addition, two main phases of [Nd0.82(La, Ce)0.18]-Fe-B and [Nd0.75(La, Ce)0.25]-Fe-B were detected by the EDX calculation, and the two main phases in both magnets were observed by magnetic domains again. Compared to magnet B, 2:14:1 main phases in magnet A contain more [Nd0.82(La, Ce)0.18]-Fe-B main phases and less [Nd0.75(La, Ce)0.25]-Fe-B main phases, which also leads to higher coercivity due to the different HA\n                      among Nd2Fe14B, La2Fe14B and Ce2Fe14B phases. Therefore, it is concluded that MM substitution could exhibit better magnetic properties than (La0.27Ce0.53Pr0.03Nd0.17)-metal substitution. Furthermore, applications of MM are beneficial to fabricate (MM, Nd)-Fe-B permanent magnets with lower cost.", "In this paper, the Rare-earth Iron Boron (RE-Fe-B) magnets were fabricated successfully by using the double main phase method through mixing the Neodymium Iron Boron (Nd-Fe-B) powders and Misch-metal Iron Boron (MM-Fe-B) powders with different ratio. Aiming at the nanocrystalline RE2Fe14B magnets prepared by using spark plasma sintering technology, phase structure and magnetic properties were investigated. It is found that the Misch-metal (MM) alloys promote the domain nucleation during the the process of magnetization reversal and then damage the coercivity (H\n                     cj) of isotropic RE2Fe14B magnets, while the H\n                     cj could still remain more than 1114.08\u202fkA/m when the mass proportion of MM (simplified as: \u201ca\u201d) is 30%. Curie temperature and phase structure were also researched. Two kinds of mixed-solid-solution (MSS) main phases with different Lanthanum (La) and Cerium (Ce) content were believed to be responsible for the two curie temperature of the RE2Fe14B magnets with \u201ca\u201d \u226520%. This is resulted from the inhomogeneous elemental distribution of RE2Fe14B phase.", "We have investigated the structural and magnetic properties of BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films grown over (100)-oriented Si substrates by rf magnetron sputtering in a new route under O2 free low pressure Ar atmosphere. Single-phase BFO films were deposited in a heated substrate and post-annealed in situ. The new routed allows high deposition rate and produce polycrystalline BFO pure phase, confirmed by high resolution X-ray diffraction. Scanning electron and atomic force microscopy reveal very low surface roughness and mean particle size of 33 nm. The BFO phase and composition were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and line scanning energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in transmission electron microscopy mode. The surface chemistry of the thin film, analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, reveals the presence of Fe3+ and Fe2+ in a 2:1 ratio, a strong indication that the film contains oxygen vacancies. An hysteretic ferromagnetic behavior with room temperature high saturation magnetization \u223c165 \u00d7 103 A/m was measured along the film perpendicular and parallel directions. Such high magnetization, deriving from this new route, is explained in the scope of oxygen vacancies, the break of the antiferromagnetic cycloidal order and the increase of spin canting by change in the surface/volume ratio. Understanding the magnetic behavior of a multiferroic thin films is a key for the development of heterogeneous layered structures and multilayered devices and the production of multiferroic materials over Si substrates opens new possibilities in the development of materials that can be directly integrated into the existent semiconductor and spintronic technologies.", "Neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) based magnets have high magnetic energy densities and thus are the material of choice for motor designs in electric vehicles, where traction motors must be as small, lightweight, and efficient as possible. However, recent fluctuations in the price of rare-earth minerals have made NdFeB a far less attractive material. Recycling NdFeB magnets is one method to mitigate price fluctuations going forward. Indeed, magnet-to-magnet recycling allows the manufacture of NdFeB magnets using end-of-use waste NdFeB feedstock materials. These recycled magnets display substantially improved magnetic and physical properties compared to precursor alloys. Herein, the performance of two identical electric motors are compared; one motor powered by recycled NdFeB magnets produced via magnet-to-magnet processing, and the other powered by conventional NdFeB magnets made from virgin elements. The results demonstrate that flux linkage measured at open circuit and the torque measured at closed circuit are 7.0% and 6.4% higher, respectively, for the motor containing recycled magnets versus the motor containing conventional magnets. This was achieved despite the 15% lower Dy content of the recycled magnets as compared to conventionally produced magnets. This performance advantage demonstrates the utility of magnet-to-magnet recycled NdFeB technology in real world applications.", "Structural, magnetic, and dielectric properties of various Mn0.5Ni0.1Zn0.4Fe2\u2212x Gdx O4 sintered at 1200\u00b0C were investigated thoroughly. The samples were synthesized by standard solid state reaction technique. The crystal structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), which has confirmed the formation of single phase spinel structure. Bulk density, average grain size and initial permeability are found to decrease with increasing Gd content. For Gd substituted compositions, the value of N\u00e9el temperature is found to increase considerably, about 200\u00b0C higher than that of the parent composition. The value of magnetic loss and dielectric loss are observed to decrease with the substitution of Gd3+ for the frequencies greater than 0.54MHz and 10kHz respectively. It is found that the AC resistivity (\u03c1 ac ) increases with the substitution of Gd3+ and the highest value of \u03c1 acis observed for the composition with x =0.03, about 600 times greater than that of parent composition.", "Device quality hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films were grown by hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) on glass (Corning 7059) using silane under high hydrogen dilution as a function of substrate temperature (TS) ranging 50\u2013515 \u00b0C. As a consequence of variation of TS, the hydrogen concentration [CH] varied from 20.0% to 0.2%. They are optically examined ex situ using Raman spectroscopy (RS) and spectroscopic phase modulated ellipsometry (SPME) from near IR to near UV (1.5\u20135.0 eV) obtaining their vibration frequencies and pseudo-dielectric function, respectively for analyzing network disorder. The ellipsometry raw data (\u3008\u03b5r(E)\u3009,\u3008\u03b5i(E)\u3009) were modeled using Bruggeman effective medium theory (BEMT) and the dispersion relations for the amorphous semiconductors comprising a two-layer model consisting of a top surface roughness layer (dS) containing an effective medium mix of 50% a-Si:H and 50% voids and a single \u201cbulk\u201d layer (dB) of a-Si:H to simulate the data reasonably well. We performed these simulations by non-linear least-square regression analysis based on Marquardt\u2013Levenberg algorithm and it was possible to estimate the true dielectric function of a-Si:H thin films and the energy band gap (Eg), besides film thickness (dSE), bulk void fraction, surface roughness layer (dS), and the confidence limits (\u03c72). Moreover, it is shown that the Tauc\u2013Lorentz (TL) model fits the ellipsometry data much better than Forouhi and Bloomer (FB) and help elucidate the layered structure of a-Si:H thin films. We also compared the optical band gap (Eg) determined using ellipsometry modeling and the Tauc gap (ET) using conventional approach. We discuss the possible physical meaning and the variation of the deduced parameters in terms of role of TS (T-role) or of hydrogen (H-role) in the dispersion model abovementioned. The bandgap was found to decrease systematically with increasing TS, reconfirming the role of hydrogen as alloy in conjunction with network relaxation, which is in agreement with excitation dependent Raman spectroscopy (i.e. strongly versus weakly absorbing) results interpreted in terms of the variation of three \u201corder parameters\u201d relating the short- and medium-range order with respect to substrate temperature. This is since, previous Raman scattering studies in various hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) materials resulted in contradicting conclusions as to the role of hydrogen on the atomic-network order. Hereby, we elucidated these contradictions using the abovementioned optical probes by establishing that the surface and the bulk of HW a-Si:H films behave differently due to their different hydrogen concentrations. Micro-Raman spectroscopy (RS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to validate the simulations also. Further consequences of these findings are also discussed in terms of other optical and structural properties. These analyses led to a correlation between the films\u2019 microstructure (or network disorder) and their electronic properties for several technological applications, in general, and for solar cells applications, in particular.", "Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) has been used to form amorphous vanadium oxide thin films from mixtures of VOCl3, O2, and H2. The deposition rate was examined as a function of PECVD operating conditions. Growth rates were found to be first order in VOCl3, and independent of both O2 and H2. High quality vanadium oxide films were also deposited without the use of hydrogen. Rates were observed to increase with rf power, and decrease with operating pressure. Maximum rates were an order of magnitude greater than typically observed with physical vapor deposition techniques. Optical transmission and electrochemical analysis were used to quantify the electrochromic response. After initial cycling films demonstrated high transparency across the visible, and the optical band gap increased with lithium intercalation. Lithium ion diffusion coefficients approached 10\u221211 cm2/s, approximately an order of magnitude higher than literature values.", "a-Si1\u2212xCx:H films are deposited by RF plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at different RF powers with hydrogen-diluted silane and methane mixture as reactive gases. The structure and properties of the thin films are measured by infrared spectroscope (IR), Raman scattering spectroscope and ultra violet\u2013visible transmission spectroscope (UV\u2013vis), respectively. Results show that the optical band gap of the a-Si1\u2212xCx:H thin films increases with increasing Si\u2013C bond fraction. It can be easily controlled through controlling Si\u2013C bond formed by modulating deposition power. At low deposition power, the bond configuration of the a-Si1\u2212xCx:H thin film is more disordered owing to the distinct different bond lengths and bond strengths between Si and C atoms. At a too high deposition power, it becomes still high disordered due to dangling bonds appearing in the a-Si1\u2212xCx:H thin film. The low disordered bond configuration appears in the thin film deposited with moderate deposition power density of about 2.5W/cm2.", "Silica thin films with embedded SnO2 nanoparticles have been grown on transparent substrates by the sol\u2013gel method. Tin dioxide crystals with cassiterite structure are semiconductors with a wide band gap of ~3.6eV. Optical absorption spectroscopy in the near ultraviolet\u2013visible range has been exploited to probe nanostructuring features of such nanocrystals. The results show that the sintering conditions modify crystallite mean size and enable the occurrence of quantum confinement effects. The outcome is in accordance with transmission electron microscopy data conducted on analogous bulk samples.", "Thin films of a-SiC:H are of interest for numerous applications in optoelectronic, nanoelectronic, and nanoelectromechanical devices due to a large optical band gap and excellent chemical inertness. In many cases, a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and high temperature stability are also desired. In this regard, we report an investigation of the influence of hydrogen content and average bond coordination (\u3008r\u3009) on the thermal stability and CTE of a-SiC:H thin films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The a-SiC:H hydrogen content determined by combined nuclear reaction analysis and Rutherford backscattering measurements (NRA\u2013RBS) was skewed from 25 to 60% resulting in films with \u3008r\u3009 ranging from 2.0 up to 3.2. We show that increased hydrogen content is accompanied by changes in the thermal stability and CTE for the a-SiC:H films. The most dramatic changes were observed to occur for films with hydrogen content >45% where \u3008r\u3009 is near the critical coordination number (\u3008r\u3009c) that delineates over and under constrained materials. For a-SiC:H films above \u3008r\u3009c, relatively little change was observed in CTE with \u3008r\u3009. However for films near or below \u3008r\u3009c, CTE was observed to increase with decreasing \u3008r\u3009 and significant hydrogen loss was observed after the annealing measurements.", "Two specific liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometric (LC\u2013MS/MS) assays were developed and validated for the determination of betamethasone (BET), and its acetate (BA) and phosphate (BP) esters. The plasma and the blood used for the development and validation of these two methods were previously stabilized. Liquid\u2013liquid extraction techniques were used after the addition of prednisolone as internal standard (IS). Samples were chromatographed using C8 column, while mass detection was carried out by electrospray ionization in the positive mode (ESI+). The method was proved linear over a working range 0.50\u201350.00ng/ml for BET (r 2 0.99), while BA linear range was 1.0\u201320.0ng/ml (r 2 0.99). Sensitivity was determined as 0.50ng/ml for BET and 1.00ng/ml for BA. Betamethasone phosphate LC\u2013MS/MS method involved solid phase extraction after the addition of prednisolone phosphate as (IS). Separation was carried out using C18 column, while detection was by ESI+. The method showed good linearity over the working range 2.0\u2013200.0ng/ml (r 2 099). Both methods were applied to determine BET, BA and BP in plasma samples obtained for pharmacokinetics studies in human.", "Covalent binding of reactive metabolites (RMs) to proteins is thought to play an important role in the processes leading to adverse drug reactions. Therefore, there is great interest in methodologies that enable the characterization of covalent binding of drugs to proteins. To facilitate the study of drug\u2013protein adducts, we have developed a liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) method for characterizing RM-modified proteins formed through drug bioactivation in human liver microsomes (HLMs), which are commonly used for the in vitro drug bioactivation studies. The technique was illustrated by the trapping of RMs of acetaminophen (APAP) and raloxifene with human glutathione S-transferase pi (hGSTP) as a model target protein. After hGSTP-supplemented HLM incubations, the modified/unmodified hGSTP fractions were collected by high-performance liquid chromatography. hGSTP fractions were digested with trypsin, and then analyzed by linear ion trap\u2013orbitrap mass spectrometry followed by a SEQUEST database search. Characteristic MS/MS fragment ions of RM-modified peptides were identified by searching for possible adducted-mass shifts. The method successfully revealed that RMs of both drugs adducted to Cys-47 of hGSTP and the mass shifts corresponded to modification by the N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine form of APAP and diquinone methide form of raloxifene, respectively. The developed method would be a possible tool for widespread use for the generation and characterization of drug\u2013protein adducts in HLMs and has the potential to assess the risk of covalent binding of drugs to proteins.", "A rapid, simple, and sensitive high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry method (LC\u2013ESI-MS/MS) was developed and validated for the determination and pharmacokinetic investigation of choline (CL), active metabolite of citicoline in human plasma using metformin (MF) as IS. The chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed-phase Phenomenx Gemini C18 column with a mobile phase of methanol:water (containing 10mM ammonium formate) (9:1, v/v). The calibration curves were linear over the range of 0.05\u20135\u03bcg/ml. The validated LC\u2013ESI-MS/MS method was successfully applied for the evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters and bioequivalence study of test and reference control release (CR) tablet preparation of citicoline 1000mg after a single oral administration to all 12 healthy male volunteers.", "A selective and sensitive method for the determination of low molecular mass organic acids (LMMOAs) in cell and mitochondrial extracts is presented. The analytical method consists in the separation by reversed phase liquid chromatography and detection with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) of the LMMOAs like malic, succinic, formic and citric acids. These acids are among the cellular intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), thus their quantitation can provide essential information about the catabolic and anabolic processes occurring in cells under physiological and pathological conditions. The analytical method was fully validated in terms of linearity, detection and quantification limits, recovery and precision. Detection limits (LOD) for malic, succinic and fumaric acids were in the range of 1\u201310nM, while 20nM was obtained for citric acid. Analytical recovery in cell and mitochondrial extracts was found between 88 and 105% (CV% \u22647.1) and matrix effect was estimated to be less than 108%. The LC\u2013MS/MS method applied to the quantification of TCA cycle metabolites revealed a different distribution of the four acids in cells and mitochondria, and it could be used to monitoring metabolic alterations associated with TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation dysfunctions.", "Vanadium pentoxide thin films, usable as positive electrode in microbatteries, have been prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering in a pure argon or mixed argon/oxygen atmosphere using a V2O5 target. Depending on the oxygen partial pressure in the discharge gas, we have obtained either crystallized or amorphous thin films, with different morphologies. These two kinds of thin films having different electrochemical behavior, an extensive XPS study was carried out. The main redox processes and their reversibility occurring during the 1st, 10th, and 30th discharge\u2013charge cycles were discussed in relation with the electrochemical properties. Our results have revealed a good reversibility of the redox process for amorphous thin films and degradation for crystallized ones, in agreement with the discharge capacity evolution. Furthermore, the growth of a surface layer between the cathode and the liquid electrolyte was evidenced upon the discharge as well as its partial dissolution upon the charge.", "Single-phased Cu2+-substituted spinel-related Li0.5Fe2.5O4 was synthesized by sintering a mixture of Cu2+-substituted corundum-related \u03b1-Fe2O3 and Li2CO3 at 700\u00b0C which is \u223c325\u2013400\u00b0C lower than the temperature at which the material is prepared by the conventional ceramic methods. X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and magnetic measurements were used to characterize the material. In contrast to high-temperature synthetic routes, the present one leads to a Cu+-and Fe2+-cation free material, thereby optimizing its technological value. Rietveld refinement of the XRD data favors a structural model in which Cu2+ substitutes for both Fe3+ and Li+ at the octahedral sites. M\u00f6ssbauer and magnetic data are consistent with this model if spin thermal reversal and/or spin canting are taken into account for the later.", "The high-K dielectric ceramics of x(0.94Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3+0.06BaTiO3)+(1\u2212x)PbZryTi1\u2212yO3 (PBZNZT) have been prepared by conventional sintering (CS) and microwave sintering (MS). The dielectric properties were improved by MS process when the sintering temperature was increased. The dielectric constants of MS samples increase with the sintering temperature due to the larger grain size. The MS process not only can enhance the homogeneity but also suppress the segregation of PbO and ZnO to grain boundaries. This leads to the substantial improvement on the dielectric properties of PBZNZT samples. The maximum dielectric constant of MS samples sintered at 1100\u00b0C for 2h is about 25,200, which is markedly greater than that of CS samples.", "Hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) thin films were deposited using HW-CVD technique at various deposition pressures. Characterisation of these films from Raman spectroscopy revealed that nc-Si:H thin films consist of a mixture of two phases, crystalline phase and amorphous phase containing small Si crystals embedded therein. We observed increase in crystallinity in the films with increase in deposition pressure whereas the size of Si nanocrystals was found \u223c2nm over the entire range of deposition pressure studied. The FTIR spectroscopic analysis showed that with increasing deposition pressure the predominant hydrogen bonding in the films shifts from, Si\u2013H to Si\u2013H2 and (Si\u2013H2)n complexes and the hydrogen content in the films was found in the range 6.2\u20139.3at% over the entire range of deposition pressure studied. The photo and dark conductivities results also indicate that the films deposited with increasing deposition pressure get structurally modified. It has been found that the optical energy gap range was between 1.72 and 2.1eV with static refractive index between 2.85 and 3.24. From the present study it has been concluded that the deposition pressure is a key process parameter to induce the crystallinity in the Si:H thin films using HW-CVD.", "A series of Nd1\u2212xCaxMnO3 (x=0.2, 0.33, 0.4, and 0.5) manganites was prepared by sol\u2013gel route by sintering at 1300\u00b0C, mainly to understand the correlation between electron, spin, and phonon couplings. The internal friction and longitudinal modulus along with electrical and magnetic properties have been measured. All the samples are found to exhibit anomalies at TC, TN, and TCO transition temperatures. The anomalies in longitudinal modulus and the internal friction peak at TCO are attributed to Jahn\u2013Teller effect. A strong correlation between the temperature dependent elastic, anelastic, resistivity, and ac susceptibility properties has been observed and an effort has been made to explain the observed anomalous behavior by a qualitative model.", "Nanocrystalline La0.65Sr0.35MnO3 powders were synthesized by modified solution combustion route. The X-ray diffraction patterns of powders calcined at different temperatures were analyzed by Rietveld programme. The synthesized bulk polycrystalline sample were in 100% perovskite phase and showed an increase in particle size from 22.9nm to 55.9nm with the increase in the calcinations temperature from 650\u00b0C to 850\u00b0C. The grain boundary of sintered pellet observed under electron microscope was devoid of any precipitation related to MnO2, SrO and the La\u2013Mn\u2013Sr\u2013O phases. The core level photoelectron spectra of lanthanum, strontium, manganese and oxygen were studied in detail. The average chemical composition obtained from the XPS measurement was found to be La0.62Sr0.38Mn1.11O3.44. Curie temperature for the 50nm powder was around 365K and saturation magnetization at 100K was 60emu/g.", "To broaden the application of antibacterial catalysts, ZnO/Ag2O composite thin films with different Ag2O contents have been successfully synthesized on non-woven fabric at room temperature by radio frequency (RF) sputtering with a single ceramic target formed by hot pressing ZnO/Ag2O nanocomposite powder in Ar atmosphere at 180\u00b0C for 30min. The composite thin films were also sputtered on glass substrates for characterizations. The best sputtering condition was found with the Ar/O2 gas flow ratio at 7:1 to obtain pure Ag2O thin film. The deposition of Ag2O nanoparticles on commercially available ZnO particles was also confirmed by HR-TEM prior to hot pressing for synthesizing ceramic targets. In this work, an appropriate amount of Ag2O incorporated in the composite film was endeavored by forming p\u2013n junction to lower the cost without decreasing bactericidal ability of composite film. The amount of 45wt% Ag2O in composite thin film to provide bactericidal effect was found to be as good as pure Ag2O. The feasibility in bactericide is due to the light sensitization of low bandgap Ag2O and the formation of nano p\u2013n heterojunction between p-type Ag2O and n-type ZnO for efficient photo carrier separation. The dependence of antibacterial effect of ZnO/Ag2O thin films on the Ag2O content is demonstrated and elucidated in this work.", "Li4Ti5O12 has been considered as a promising electrode material for lithium secondary batteries. In this work a spray drying process was developed to prepare porous and spherical Li4Ti5O12 powders with Li2CO3 and rutile type TiO2 as precursors and PVB as forming agent of pores. The experimental results showed that porous and spherical morphology of the spray-dried powders was maintained during the sintering and the subsequent heat treatment. The oxygen atmosphere was demonstrated important to the electrochemical performance of the Li4Ti5O12 powders. However, overtime heat treatment would result in superfluous loss of lithium content and therefore led to obvious decrease of charge and discharge capacities.", "Monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 can be synthesized by solid-state reaction using either hydrogen or carbon as the reducing agent when sintering temperatures are higher than 800\u00b0C. The initial capacity of Li3V2(PO4)3 synthesized using hydrogen as the reducing agent increases with increasing sintering temperature T and then for T 900\u00b0C decreases monotonically, and the sample synthesized at 900\u00b0C present the highest initial capacity of 146.3mAhg\u22121, but exhibit poor cycle performance. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show that Li3V2(PO4)3 particles with small uniform particle size can be obtained at 900\u00b0C. X-ray diffraction patterns of electrodes before and after cycling indicate that the capacity fading is not related to structure collapse. The carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP/C) composites are synthesized by carbo-thermal reduction method at the optimized temperature of 900\u00b0C. The LVP/C exhibit good cycle performance (137.5mAhg\u22121 at 50th cycle under 1C rate, 94.6% of initial discharge capacity) and rate behavior (111.0mAhg\u22121 under 5C rate for initial discharge) for the fully de-lithiated (3\u20134.8V) samples. Our results suggest, based on the SEM images, that the good capacity retention and rate performance are owing to the nanometer size carbon webs coated the Li3V2(PO4)3 particles with both the greater specific surface area and the small uniform particle size.", "Carbon-coated sulfur cathodes were prepared by sputtering method and electrochemical properties of lithium/sulfur cells were investigated. As a result of charge/discharge test, sulfur cathode having carbon layer of 180\u00c5 showed the highest capacity of 1178mAhg\u22121 at first discharge. Moreover, discharge capacity showed about 500mAhg\u22121 until 50th cycle, which is two times larger than that of no-coated sulfur cathode. This capacity increase could be considered due to the decrease of polysulfides dissolution and the enhancement of electrical contact by surface carbon layer. The changes of sulfur cathode during discharge process were investigated by SEM observation, XRD and DSC measurements. From these results, a discharge reaction mechanism of lithium/carbon-coated sulfur cell was suggested.", "Lithium vanadium oxide has been synthesized as an anode material for lithium ion batteries by spray pyrolysis technique. The precursor prepared by spray pyrolysis is sintered at 1000\u00b0C under 10% H2/Ar atmosphere.Highly crystallized hexagonal lithium vanadate, Li1+x VO2, is obtained without any impurities. The product has mean particle size of 7\u20138\u03bcm. Lattice parameters of as-prepared powders vary largely according to Li/V ratio. The powder having the lowest c/a ratio shows the largest discharge capacity. Optimum x value is 0.2 in the view point of the discharge capacity (294mAhg\u22121) and the cycle retention (90%, after 25 cycles).Structural change of as-prepared lithium vanadate is investigated by ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis on charged electrodes at various state of charge (SOC). Lithium vanadate undergoes two step phase transition during charging process and its main peak gets broader as the charge state gets higher. This peak broadening is explained by the breaking down of particles at high SOC.", "An Al2O3 inorganic separator is prepared by a double sintering process. The Al2O3 separator has a high porosity and good mechanical strength. After the liquid electrolyte is infiltrated, the separator exhibits quite high ionic conductivities, and even the conductivity reaches 0.78mScm\u22121 at \u221220\u00b0C. Furthermore, the inorganic separator has an advantage over the polymer separator in the electrolyte retention. The LiFePO4/graphite cell using the Al2O3 inorganic separator shows higher discharge capacity and rate capability, and better low-temperature performance than that using the commercial polymer separator, which indicates that the Al2O3 separator is very promising to be applied in the lithium-ion batteries.", "A novel hydrothermal stripping technique is developed to synthesize pure LiFePO4 and LiFePO4/C cathode materials. The pure sample is directly synthesized by the cation exchange between the organic phase which is prepared with FeSO4\u00b77H2O and naphthenic acid, and aqueous phase prepared with H3PO4 and LiOH. SEM exhibits that the primary sizes of the well-distributed LiFePO4 and LiFePO4/C particles are about 150\u00a0nm and 100\u00a0nm in diameter, respectively. TEM indicates the LiFePO4/C is uniformly coated with a carbon layer about 2.7\u00a0nm in size. The as-prepared LiFePO4 exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 135.5\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 at 0.1\u00a0C, and the LiFePO4/C composite sintered at 650\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h exhibits the best electrode properties with discharge capacities of 151.7, 154.8, 149.8 and 139.1\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 at 0.1\u00a0C, 0.2\u00a0C, 0.5\u00a0C and 1.0\u00a0C rates, respectively. In addition, the LiFePO4/C also shows excellent capacity retention and cycle performances.", "LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) is one of the most promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles, which is successfully adopted in Tesla. However, the dissolution of the cation into the electrolyte is still a one of the major challenges (fading capacity and poor cyclability, etc.) presented in pristine NCA. Herein, a homogeneous nanoscale ZnO film is directly sputtered on the surface of NCA electrode via the magnetron sputtering (MS). This ZnO film is evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results clearly demonstrate that ZnO film is fully and uniformly covered on the NCA electrodes. After 90 cycles at 1.0C, the optimized MS-2min coated NCA electrode delivers much higher discharge capacity with 169\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 than that of the pristine NCA electrode with 127\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121. In addition, the discharge capacity also reaches 166\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 at 3.0C, as compared to that of 125\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 for the pristine electrode. The improved electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the superiority of the MS ZnO film that reduce charge transfer resistance and protect the NCA electrode from cation dissolution.", "An investigation of the morphology of lithium-cobalt-oxide (LCO) films for the production of energy dense, solid-state, thin-film batteries with cathodes in the 10\u00a0\u03bcm thickness range is described. It was found that, in order to achieve devices with over 80% charge utilization, capable of extended cycling, with cathodes greater than 5\u00a0\u03bcm, LCO film texture must be actively controlled to maintain orientations preferential to Li diffusion. It was found that the oxygen: argon ratio during sputtering of the cathode plays a critical role in determining the crystallographic texture of LCO films thicker than 5\u00a0\u03bcm. Specifically, LCO films deposited with an oxygen presence of as little as 4% in Ar showed no detectable (003) peak following anneal. Working cells were fabricated using texture-controlled 10\u00a0\u03bcm cathodes, exhibiting discharge capacities of 60\u00a0\u03bcAh/cm2-\u03bcm (600\u00a0\u03bcAh/cm2) at C/10, with greater than 95% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a C/5 discharge rate. Cells with 10\u00a0\u03bcm cathodes and un-controlled (predominantly (003)) texture were capable of achieving similar capacities, however their rate and cycling performance were severely diminished.", "The rhombohedral LiSn2(PO4)3 was prepared by solid-state method for the anode material of lithium-ion battery. The effect of pH value of hydrothermal reaction system on the morphology of SnO2 as the precursor of LiSn2(PO4)3 and the influence of heat-treatment procedure and conditions, such as the sintering temperature and time, on the property of LiSn2(PO4)3 were investigated. The purity, morphology, structure and size distribution of prepared LiSn2(PO4)3 were characterized respectively by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. The results demonstrate that the as-prepared LiSn2(PO4)3 particles exhibit rhombohedral single-crystal structure with an average particle size of 200\u00a0nm. The electrochemical measurement results reveal that the as-prepared LiSn2(PO4)3/C electrode exhibits the improved cycling stability and reversibility with a reversible discharge capacity of 448.6\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121 at 100\u00a0mA\u00a0g\u22121 and better rate capability of 332.6\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121 at 500\u00a0mA\u00a0g\u22121. The charge-discharge mechanism of LiSn2(PO4)3/C electrode was also investigated. According to the test results of cyclic voltammetry, the electrode process includes not only the intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions in the LiSn2(PO4)3 particles, but also the surface pseudo-capacitive effect.", "Skutterudite-based compounds, Co4Sb12\u2212x\u2212y Tex Sey(x=0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and y=0.0, 0.1), are synthesized by the solid state reaction and the spark plasma sintering methods, and their structure and the thermoelectric properties have been investigated systematically. It is found that Se doping results in decrease of the lattice parameter and refinement of the particle size compared with those of Se-free samples. The Se-doped samples do not yield a certain increase in the power factor, but show a significant depression in the lattice thermal conductivity. The highest dimensionless figure of merit ZT=1.09 is achieved at 800K for the Co4Sb11.3Te0.6Se0.1 compound, which is improved by 15% compared with that of Te alone doped Co4Sb11.4Te0.6 compound at the corresponding temperature.", "CrSi2 material is outstanding because of its thermoelectric properties and also because of its many optimization routes. Indeed, its thermal conductivity at room temperature is about 9Wm\u22121K\u22121 with a ZT of 0.25. In this paper we propose to decrease the thermal conductivity by nanostructuration and compensate the electron scattering by increasing the charge carrier concentration with Ti. The process which permitted to get nanocrystallite of about 14nm is presented. After cold pressing and sintering the average crystallite size reaches 50nm with a porosity of 70%. Nanostructuring and porosity to a lesser extent lead to a strong decrease of the thermal conductivity up to 0.9\u00b10.15Wm\u22121K\u22121 for pure CrSi2. A significant enhancement of the power factor from 1.25\u03bcW cm \u2212 1 K \u2212 2 for pure nano-CrSi2 to 2.5\u03bcW cm \u2212 1 K \u2212 2 for nano-Cr0.90Ti0.10Si2 was obtained. The stability of the different phases is also evaluated by comparing experiments with ab initio calculations.", "The study of Mg2Si1\u2212x Snx -based thermoelectric materials has received widespread attention due to a potentially high thermoelectric performance, abundant raw materials, relatively low cost of modules, and non-toxic character of compounds. In this research, Mg2.16(Si0.4Sn0.6)1\u2212y Biysolid solutions with the nominal Bi content of 0\u2264y\u22640.03 are prepared using a two-step solid state reaction followed by spark plasma sintering consolidation. Within this range of Bi concentrations, no evidence of second phase segregation was found. Bi is confirmed to occupy the Si/Sn sites in the crystal lattice and behaves as an efficient n-type dopant in Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6. Similar to the effect of Sb, Bi doping greatly increases the electron density and the power factor, and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity of Mg2.16Si0.4Sn0.6 solid solutions. Overall, the thermoelectric figure of merit of Bi-doped Mg2.16Si0.4Sn0.6 solid solutions is improved by about 10% in comparison to values obtained with Sb-doped materials of comparable dopant content. This improvement comes chiefly from a marginally higher Seebeck coefficient of Bi-doped solid solutions. The highest ZT\u223c1.4 is achieved for the y=0.03 composition at 800K.", "Alpha\u2033-Fe16N2 nanoparticles (NPs) with high magnetic crystalline anisotropy are useful for practical applications such as recording media. However, due to their strongly aggregated and/or sintered form, which occurs during synthesis, the utilization of the NPs has been limited thus far. Here, we report a method for synthesizing highly dispersive \u03b1\u2033-Fe16N2 NPs using hydroxyapatite (HAp). The chemically and thermally stable structure of the HAp coating results in the isolation of individual NPs, such that sintering is prevented during synthesis. Additionally, the acicular shape of the HAp crystal did not hinder gas diffusion during the gas reaction. Finally, HAp can be removed by a chelating agent without deteriorating the magnetic properties, resulting in highly dispersive \u03b1\u2033-Fe16N2 NPs.", "An overview is presented on the variation of electrical conductivity, oxygen permeation, and thermal expansion coefficient as a function of the composition of perovskites in the quasi-ternary system LaFeO3\u2013LaCoO3\u2013LaNiO3. Powders of thirteen nominal perovskite compositions were synthesized under identical conditions by the Pechini method. The powder X-ray diffraction data of two series, namely La(Ni0.5Fe0.5)1\u2212x Cox O3 and LaNi0.5-x Fex Co0.5O3, are presented after the powders had been sintered at 1100\u00b0C for 6h in air. The measurements revealed a rhombohedral structure for all compositions except LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 for which 60% rhombohedral and 40% orthorhombic phase was found. The maximum DC electrical conductivity value of the perovskites at 800\u00b0C was 1229Scm\u22121 for the composition LaCoO3 and the minimum was 91Scm\u22121 for the composition LaCo0.5Fe0.5O3. The oxygen permeation of samples with promising conductivities at 800\u00b0C was one order of magnitude lower than that of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF). The highest value of 0.017mlcm\u22122 min\u22121 at 950\u00b0C was obtained with LaNi0.5Co0.5O3. The coefficients of thermal expansion varied in the range of 13.2\u00d710\u22126 K\u22121 and 21.9\u00d710\u22126 K\u22121 for LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 and LaCoO3, respectively. 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy was used as probe for the oxidation states, local environment and magnetic properties of iron ions as a function of chemical composition. The substitution had a great influence on the chemical properties of the materials.", "Chalcogenide compounds of composition ABX2 (with A, B, representing metal elements, X as the chalcogenide) have recently been attracting attention as thermoelectric materials. Possible magnetic enhancement of the thermoelectric properties has been proposed for electron-doped chalcopyrite CuFeS2 which exhibits large power factors at room temperature. Promising ZT values close to 1 have been reported for TmAgTe2 or YCuTe2 due to very low thermal conductivities (< 0.5Wm\u22121K\u22121 at 800K) resulting from a disordered sublattice of Cu atoms. To further explore the possibilities of the ABX2 compounds, we study GdCu1+xTe2 which is a monoclinic layered compound that crystallizes in the C2/m space group, and has the f-electron Gd as a magnetic element, versus d-electron Fe in CuFeS2. Although the stoichiometric compound could not be stabilized, we report on the properties of this series of compounds sintered by spark plasma sintering (SPS). As for the other materials of ABX2 type, compositions with x > 0.25 show very low thermal conductivities (0.64Wm\u22121K\u22121 above 500K for x = 0.25), which, together with a Seebeck coefficient above 0.2mVK\u22121, allows to reach a moderate ZT value near 0.2 at 540K. We also discuss the dependence with the Cu excess content of the transport properties and the lack of effect of the magnetic moment of Gd on the Seebeck coefficient.", "Ferroelectromagnetic BaFe0.5Nb0.5O3 (BFN) ceramics and ferroelectromagnetic composites based on BFN powder and ferrite powder have been obtained in the presented work. The percentage of components in a two-phase composite was: biferroic powder BFN in the amount of 90%, and nickel\u2013zinc ferrite Ni1\u2212xZnxFe2O4 for x=0.36 in the amount of 10%. The synthesis of the components of the BFN\u2013ferrite composite was performed using the calcination method. Final densification of the synthesized powder was done using free sintering. For the obtained two-phase ceramic BFN\u2013ferrite composite, the XRD, microstructure, EDS, dielectric, impedances, magnetic, M\u00f6ssbauer and electrical hysteresis loop investigations were performed. The obtained results show correlations between the magnetic subsystem and the electrical subsystem of the ferroelectromagnetic composite. Such properties of the obtained composite give a possibility to use them in memory applications of a new type.", "The morphology and magnetic properties of the crystalline and ball-milled Ho(Ni0.5Fe0.5)3 intermetallic compounds are studied. The presence of PuNi3 type of crystal structure was confirmed in crystalline as well as powdered samples. The emergence of a partly amorphous phase was confirmed at the end of the pulverization process. The use of the ball-milling method for various grinding time is reflected in the fabrication of nanostructured flakes, with a thickness of less than 100nm. Prolonged milling favors an assemblage of as-prepared nanopowder. The increase of pulverization time leads to the reduction in crystallites sizes confirmed by a variety of complementary measurement methods. Moreover, the increase in comminution duration results in the enhancement of the coercivity (H C), non-linear dependence of remanence (M r) and emergence of Mr./MS ratio to values higher than 0.5. A quantitative analysis of XPS spectra shows an increase of Fe concentration versus sputtering which is in coincidence with magnetic measurements.", "PZT thin films have been prepared via metalorganic CVD (MOCVD) on four substrates of conducting oxides of ruthenates, SrRuO3/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si(100), SrRuO3/SiO2/Si(100), CaRuO3/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si(100), CaRuO3/SiO2/Si(100). The conducting ruthenate layers were also grown using MOCVD. Ferroelectric properties of polarization fatigue and leakage current density are measured. The internal strain of PZT thin crystal which is mainly constrained by the bottom electrode seems to be the decisive factor in ferroelectric properties. The internal strain of PZT is represented by its tetragonality ratio. The PZT thin film in the capacitor Au/PZT/SrRuO3/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si, with the largest tetragonality ratio 1.026, exhibits an optimum combination of large polarization, less fatigue, and low leakage current density. Both SrRuO3 and CaRuO3 are good diffusion barriers to prevent interdiffusion of cations between the ferroelectric and the electrode. The slightly higher intermixing at the CaRuO3-to-Pt/Ti interface is owing to the high annealing temperature needed in CaRuO3 synthesis.", "Artificial superlattices consisting of ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO), and conductive LaNiO3 (LNO) layers were successfully prepared by rf magnetron sputtering with dual guns. The (001)-textured BTO and LNO layers were sequentially and coherently grown on (001)LNO/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates. The formation of superlattice structure was confirmed from the X-ray diffraction, cross-sectional image of transmission electron microscopy and depth profile of secondary ion mass spectrometer. An expansion of the c-axis of the BTO lattice was induced by the insertion of the LNO layers having a smaller lattice, and the expansion only slightly increases with the reduction of stacking periodicity of BTO layer below 12nm. The formation of a conductive interdiffusion layer of 1.5\u20132.0nm thick between the adjacent BTO and LNO layers was also found. A significant, but nearly the same extent, dielectric enhancement was achieved in the BTO/LNO superlattice with stacking periodicity of BTO \u2264 12nm. The temperature dependence of dielectric constant also reveals the shift-up of Curie temperature in the strained BTO.", "Bilayered LiNbO3 (LN) thin films were successfully deposited onto In2O3:SnO2 (ITO)-coated Si substrates by radio-frequency sputtering. The crystalline perfection and crystallographic orientation could be significantly improved by LiNbO3 template surface. This paper reviews the structural, morphological, compositional and ferroelectric properties of such as-grown heterostructures underlying key issues concerning the strategy used to improve the crystal quality and control the layer polarity.", "Nanostructured titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films were deposited on unheated glass substrates by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. The influence of the oxygen percentage in the discharge and the sputtering power (P) on the phase composition, crystallinity, surface morphology and optical properties of the films was investigated. The structure of the as-sputtered TiO2 films prepared in different oxygen concentrations for P=500W and 1000W varies from amorphous to crystalline. X-ray diffraction revealed that, excluding the lowest oxygen concentration (1% O2), all annealed TiO2 thin films at 400\u00b0C/4h have an anatase crystal structure and the crystallinity decreases with the oxygen percentage. However, for 5 and 10% O2, the films are textured with the (101) crystal direction normal to the substrate surface and for O2\u226515% the films have the preferred orientation (004), which is accounted for different surface energies associated with different planes. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) evidence distinct modifications in the morphology of the thin films which are corroborated with the crystallite sizes estimated from the typical diffraction peaks. Agglomeration of smaller TiO2 nano-sized grains to form bigger sized particulates is observed and enhanced by the decrease in oxygen content. With the variation in oxygen concentration, the optical properties (refractive index and optical band gap) of TiO2 films also change strongly being dependent on crystallinity, crystallite size and oxygen vacancies.", "Large-area ordered TiO2 nanostructural arrays with tunable shapes were fabricated by annealing the magnetron sputtered Ti on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates in air at 400\u00b0C for 6h. The morphology of the sputtered TiO2 nanostructural film was controlled by adjusting the parameters of the porous AAO substrate. XRD measurement shows the annealed TiO2 nanotubular film is polycrystalline anatase phase without preferred orientation. Photoluminescence (PL) measurement reveals the TiO2 nanostructural film is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with oxygen vacancy defects. These nanostructural arrays may find potential applications in photocatalytic and photovoltaic devices.", "A systematic study of the effects of processing parameters on the structure, microstructure, magnetic, and magnetotransport properties of lanthanum manganite (LMO) ceramics are presented. LMO ceramics are prepared using solid-state reaction technique by applying wide range of sintering temperatures 1100\u20131500\u00b0C with varying holding times. It is observed that phase pure LMO can be formed at a sintering temperature of 1300\u00b0C for a short duration of 2h with measured density 4.8gcm\u22123. Density does not improve with lower sintering temperature and longer duration. The grains appeared are quite homogeneous and uniform and do not differ much with further increase of temperature, however, less voids and higher leakage currents are observed for the LMO samples sintered at higher temperature. As the physical properties of manganites depend of structure, composition and oxidation states of Mn ions, XPS analysis are done to study the valence states. XPS analysis shows that LMO ceramics sintered at higher temperature have lower Mn valence and values approaches towards +2 as well as the loss of oxygen stoichiometry. All the samples show colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) behavior, however, the LMO prepared by sintering at 1300\u00b0C for 2h shows the highest MR% \u223c60%.", "Lanthanum substituted barium titanate (BT), Ba(1\u2212x)LaxTi(1\u2212x/4)O3 (where x=0.02,0.04,0.06 and 0.08)/BLT1, BLT2, BLT3 and BLT4 ferroelectric ceramic samples were synthesized in single perovskite phase by microwave (MW) processing technique. Dense packing of grains with higher density at lower sintering temperature (1100\u00b0C) signifies the importance of MW process over conventional process. The structure changes from tetragonal to cubic and grain size gradually decreases with the increase in La3+ ions substitution concentration in BT ceramic samples. Presence of pore free uniform grains suggested the advantage of using microwave sintering process. Transition temperature (Tc) decreases with the increase in La3+ ions substitution concentration in BT system and for BLT3 and BLT4 systems Tc is below room temperature (RT). Temperature coefficient of capacitance is negligible from RT temperature to 75\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C for BLT1 and BLT2 ceramic samples, respectively. Ferroelectric study confirms the transformation of structure from tetragonal to cubic with the increase of La3+ ion substitution concentration in BT system.", "Modifications in optical and electronic properties of wurtzite GaN induced by Cr doping were studied using various experimental techniques and Density Functional Theory (DFT) based calculations. Metal Oxide Chemical Vapor Deposited grown GaN/sapphire thin film samples were implanted by Cr ions at 300 keV to achieve three different doses of 5 \u00d7 1014, 5 \u00d7 1015 and 5 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22122. X-ray diffraction, Atomic force microscopy, Spectroscopy ellipsometry, UV\u2013vis spectrophotometery, Hall and Vibrating Sample Magnetometery measurements were carried out to study structural, optical, electrical and magnetic properties of as-grown, annealed as-grown and annealed implanted GaN samples. A dose dependent decrease in band gap of the material was observed in implanted samples. Complex refractive index, dielectric constants, energy band gap and carrier concentration based on these measurements are reported for the materials. Moreover, the results indicated substitution of Cr in host GaN lattice. Results of band structure (BS) based on DFT calculations using GGA for pure and Cr doped wurtzite GaN are also reported and discussed here. The results indicated that GaCrN is a potential material for optoelectronic and spintronics devices.", "Lead titanate and strontium hexaferrite multiferroic composite with general formula (x)PbTiO3 \u2013 (1 \u2212 x)SrFe12O19 (where x = 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.50) was prepared using solid state sintering method. Lead titanate and strontium hexaferrite phase formation was identified using X-ray diffraction technique, thus establishing diphase system without any secondary phase. Calculation of lattice parameter shows that the composite prefers hexagonal structure. The morphology of the formation of composite was seen through scanning electron microscopic technique. The morphological investigations show that the composites are dense, have fewer pores and ferroelectric grains are homogenously distributed in the ferrite matrix. The ferroelectric and ferromagnetic grains are identified on the basis of energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) studies. The magnetic behavior of the composites at room temperature display magnetic hysteresis loop, indicating that the composites are ferromagnetic. The value of saturation magnetization decreases with increase in ferroelectric content from x = 0.10 to 0.30, whereas for x = 0.50 it shows an increase. The magneto-capacitance shows a decrease in its value due to magnetostriction.", "As promising candidate materials for permanent magnets, (1 \u2212 x)BaFe12O19/xCoFe2O4 composite ceramics (with x = 10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt%, 40 wt%) were prepared by the microwave sintering (MS) techniques. The phase composition and surface morphology of the composites were investigated using XRD and SEM, respectively. The magnetic properties of the composites were also studied. The results show that all the composite ceramics indicate an excellent exchange coupling behavior. The simultaneous enhancements of 12.84% in remanence and 32.20% in (BH)max, compared with the parent hard ferrite (BaFe12O19) has been achieved. The exchange coupling between the hard and soft grains can be confirmed by the switching field distribution curves.", "Ba4Pr2Fe2Nb8O30 tungsten bronze ceramics have been prepared by a standard solid-state sintering method, and the electrical, dielectric and ferroelectric properties have been determined together with the structure. The structure dependence of ferroelectricity has been investigated by comparing the as-sintered, N2-annealed and O2-annealed samples. The typical relaxor ferroelectric nature is generally indicated in the present ceramics, where the broaden dielectric constant and dielectric loss peaks with strong frequency dispersion feature are observed. The peak temperatures for both dielectric constant and dielectric loss are significantly increased together with the much stronger frequency dispersion by N2-annealing, while the O2-annealing results in the decreased peak temperatures and the suppressed frequency dispersion. These phenomena are closely related to the valences of Fe and Pr ions. The hopping between Fe2+ and Fe3+ inside the grains causes the dielectric relaxation in as-sintered and N2-annealed samples. The enhanced ferroelectricity near room temperature is attributed to the increased ion radius difference between A1 and A2 ions because of the \u201csubstitution\u201d Pr4+ for Pr3+ after N2-annealing.", "The spinel system NiCrxFe2-xO4 with composition x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 were obtained by solid state sintering technique in air at 1350 \u00b0C. X-ray and neutron powder diffraction experiments have been performed on the samples at room temperature to characterize the materials. The formation of the single phase cubic spinel structure has been confirmed by the sharp peaks of X-ray diffraction patterns for all the samples. Rietveld refinement of the neutron diffraction data showed cubic symmetry corresponding to the space group F d3-m. The distributions of cations over the two sublattices and other crystallographic parameters have been determined precisely from the analysis of the neutron diffraction data. The cell parameter decreases with increasing Cr content in the system. The tetrahedral and octahedral bond distances have been calculated from the analysis of the neutron diffraction data. Sublattices and net magnetic moments were deduced from the refinement of neutron diffraction data. The magnetic structure at room temperature was found to be ferrimagnetic for the samples x \u2264 0.8 with no remarkable magnetic moments at x = 1.0.", "In this study, aligned nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (A-CNTs) have been synthesized by Aerosol Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition. Three solutions were nebulized (toluene, acetonitrile, 1:1 toluene/acetonitrile) and the as synthesized carbon nanostructures formed were collected from the three different reactions. After synthesis, the A-CNTs were purified by acid treatment and retained for further analysis. The effect of in-situ nitrogen doping on the internal structure of the aligned carbon nanotube bundles was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy studies confirmed the formation of bamboo like tubes upon nitrogen doping. Thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that nitrogen doping does not significantly degrade the thermal stability of the A-CNT samples. The structural properties of the A-CNT after incorporation of nitrogen and the subsequent formation of bamboo-like tubes were studied by Raman spectroscopy. The presence of ferromagnetic impurities was identified by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy as \u03b1-Fe, \u03b3-Fe, Fe2O3 and Fe3C, and these were further confirmed by SQUID hysteresis and temperature dependence magnetization data.", "The present investigation deals with designing Fe, Fe\u2013P binary and Fe\u2013P\u2013Si ternary alloys produced by an in-house developed powder metallurgical technique based on \u2018Hot Powder Preform Forging\u2019. Proper soaking of preforms at high temperature (1050\u00b0C) eliminates iron-phosphide eutectic and brings entire phosphorus into solution in iron. Attempting hot forging thereafter completely eliminates hot as well as cold shortness and thereby helps to form these preforms (alloys) into very thin sheets of 0.5mm. The use of costly hydrogen atmosphere during sintering has been eliminated by the addition of carbon as a reducing agent to form CO gas within the compact by reacting with oxygen of iron powder particles. The glassy ceramic coating applied over the compact serves as a protective coating to avoid atmospheric oxygen attack over the compact held at high temperature. These alloys so formed were subjected to density examination at various stages. Microstructural study has been carried out to estimate the grain size, volume percentage of porosity in the alloys, and uniform distribution of phosphorus and silicon in an iron matrix. X-ray diffraction studies of these alloys revealed the presence of only ferrite as product phase. Addition of alloying elements such as P and Si has improved the resistivity and magnetic properties of iron. Fe\u20130.07C\u20130.2O\u20130.3P\u20130.5Si alloy showed a resistivity as high as 31.7\u03bc\u03a9cm. Coercivity values of the alloys ranged from 0.51 to 1.98Oe. The total magnetic loss of Fe\u20130.07C\u20130.2O\u20130.3P\u20130.5Si alloy was the lowest (2.03W/kg) amongst the alloys developed owing to its high resistivity combined with its low coercivity. These alloys which are drawn to thin sheets could find their possible application in the manufacturing of transformer cores.", "Precursor powders of calcia-stabilized zirconia (CSZ) solid electrolytes have been synthesized by a sol\u2013gel method. The phase evolution of the precursor powders after thermal treatments at different temperatures were analysized by X-ray diffraction technique. Disc-shaped sensor elements were fabricated via uniaxial pressing of the calcined powders and subsequently sintered at 1650\u00b0C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the microstructure of the sintered pellets. Platinum electrodes were applied to the sintered elements to produce potentiometric/electrochemical gas sensors. The electrical response of the gas sensors to oxygen and the complex impedance of the sensors in air were measured at various temperatures. Impedance analyses indicate that the sensor cell with 15mol% CaO has much lower resistance (the sum of bulk and grain-boundary resistance) than the sensor cell with 22mol% CaO. This is also reflected by the EMF responses of both sensor cells to various oxygen concentrations in the testing gas. The EMF deviation from the theoretical value of the CSZ sensor cell with 22mol% CaO was larger than that of the CSZ sensor cell with 15mol% CaO. The corrrelations between material compositions, microstructures of the sintered pellets and the electrical properties of the sensors are discussed.", "In this work, we report the preparation of lanthanum-modified lead zirconate titanate (PLZT) thin films by RF magnetron sputtering on platinized silicon (Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si) substrate. Sputtering was done in pure argon at 100W RF power without external substrate heating. X-ray diffraction studies were performed on the films to study the effect of post-deposition furnace annealing temperature and time on the perovskite phase formation of PLZT. Annealing at 650\u00b0C for 2h was found to be optimum for the preparation of PLZT films in pure perovskite phase. The effect of different annealing conditions on surface morphology of the films was examined using AFM. The dielectric, ferroelectric and electrical properties of these films were also investigated in detail as a function of different annealing conditions. The pure perovskite film exhibits better properties than the other films which have some fraction of unwanted pyrochlore phase. The remanent polarization for pure perovskite film was found to be \u223c29\u03bcC/cm2 which is almost double compared to the films having mixed phases. The dc resistivity of the pure perovskite film was found to be 7.7\u00d71010\u03a9cm at the electric field of \u223c80kV/cm.", "We report our novel result regarding the observation of unusual but clean ferromagnetic (FM) signature at room temperature (RT) in high pure (99.999%) ZnO bulk ceramics processed by slow step sintering schedule (SSSS). All the sintered samples showed ferromagnetic signature at room temperature. However, sample sintered at 850\u00b0C showed more prominent M\u2013H loop and saturation magnetization with respect to samples sintered at 500\u00b0C and 1300\u00b0C. Observation of FM behavior in sintered ceramics may be attributed to the presence of defects like cation (Zn)/anion (O) vacancies and interstitials created during the processing of sample. It is anticipated that SSSS promotes enhanced physical bulk as well as surface densification and at the same time confined the outgassing of free oxygen and Zn from the bulk which are acting as suitable defect sites inside the sintered grains and grain boundary junctions. Our micro-Raman and X-ray photoelectron studies revealed the existence of these defects which are believed to be the origin of the unconventional ferromagnetism (FM) of ZnO bulk ceramic at room temperature.", "Nanocrystalline powders of nickel substituted zinc ferrite with general formula NixZn1\u2212xFe2O4 (x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) have been synthesized via sol\u2013gel auto-combustion method using tartaric acid as combustion-complexing agent. Samples were sintered at 773K and 973K in static air atmosphere. The absence of the organic phase and the spinel formation were monitored by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The structure and crystallite size were analyzed from X-ray diffraction data revealing spinel mono-phase formation in the range of nanometric crystallite size confirmed also through scanning electron microscopy. Mean size of crystallites lay in the range 20\u201340nm. The influence of nickel content on the microstructure was investigated considering the crystallite size, distance between adjacent crystal planes, lattice parameter and porosity. The variation of magnetic properties of the samples was studied by using vibrating samples magnetometer and discussed considering the proposed cation distribution, relative bond angles and canting angles. The highest maximum value of the magnetization (63emu/g) was found for Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4.", "This paper presents the effect of GeO2 glass former on the physical and electrical properties of BaFe0.5Nb0.5O3 (BFN) perovskite ceramics. The BFN powder was prepared by a conventional mixed-oxide method and the GeO2 contents, ranging from 1 to 5wt.%, were subsequently added to the calcined BFN powder. The mixtures were pressed and sintered to form dense ceramics. We showed that, with the addition of GeO2, the maximum density was achieved at lower sintering temperature, approximately 200\u2013225\u00b0C lower than those required by the pure BFN ceramic. However, the densities of these GeO2 doped BFN ceramics were slightly lower than those of pure BFN due to the occurrence of pores. We also found that the addition of GeO2 reduces the dielectric loss at room temperature from 4.29 to 0.39\u20130.79 but the dielectric constant at room temperature decreased with the increased GeO2 concentrations. With small amount of added GeO2, ferroelectric property of BFN ceramics was also obtained, as confirmed by their hysteresis loops.", "Nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) thin films deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at various silane flow rates ([SiH4]) are studied. The characterization of these films by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction reveals that no film and very thin film is deposited at [SiH4]=0.0 and 0.1sccm, respectively. In addition, the structural change from an amorphous to a nanocrystalline phase occurs at around [SiH4]=0.2sccm. In this study, the importance of arriving species at surfaces and precursors is clearly demonstrated by the effect of a small addition of SiH4 on the frequency and width of a Raman peak and the structure of the grown film. The infrared spectroscopic analysis shows no hydrogen incorporation in the nc-Si film deposited at the low value of [SiH4]. However, the intensity of the peak around 2100cm\u22121 due to SiH decreases with increasing [SiH4]. All fabricated films give photoluminescence in the range between 1.7 and 2.4eV at room temperature, indicating enlargement of the band-gap energy. The presence of very small crystallites leads to the appearance of quantum confinement effects. The variations of the photoluminescence energy and spectral width are well correlated with the structural properties of the films such as crystallite size, crystalline volume fraction, and the density of Si-H bonds.", "Effects of charge defects on electrical properties of BiFeO3/Bi0.90La0.10Fe0.85Zn0.15O3 (BFO/BLFZO) bilayered thin films are investigated, and the concentration of charge defects is controlled by changing their deposition temperatures during sputtering. It is of great interest to note that these bilayers endure an orientation transition from (100) to (110) with increasing deposition temperatures. An enhanced dielectric, ferroelectric, and fatigue behavior has been demonstrated in these bilayers deposited at an optimum growth window. A better electrical behavior of 2Pr~138.2\u03bcC/cm2, 2Ec~657.3kV/cm, \u03b5r~189, and tan\u03b4~2.72% has been demonstrated in BFO/BLFZO bilayers, and the underlying physical mechanism is also addressed.", "LiCoO2 single-layer and LiCoO2/LiNiO2 multi-layer thin film electrodes were successfully fabricated by magnetron sputtering. Their microstructure and electrochemical properties were investigated. Once annealed, both films had the (003) preferred orientation to minimize the surface energy. The initial discharge capacity of the multi-layer thin film was approximately 53.1\u03bcAh/cm2\u03bcm, which was higher than that of the LiCoO2 single-layer thin film having similar thickness. The capacity retention of the multi-layer thin film was superior to that of the single-layer thin film. These findings indicate that the multi-layer thin film is a promising cathode material for the fabrication of high-performance thin film batteries.", "The pure single phase of multiferroic material TbMnO3 powders were successfully synthesized by one-step molten salt synthesis (MSS) method in the NaCl\u2013Na2SO4 eutectic salts at the temperature as low as 800\u00b0C for 1h. The temperature of synthesized high purity TbMnO3 is limited in a very narrow range. Prolonging the sintering time will not have an effect on the purity of samples, and either lower or higher salt concentration is not conducive to form pure TbMnO3. The obtained TbMnO3 was indexed to an orthorhombically distorted perovskite phase. The as-prepared crystals exhibit uniform and regular rhombic-like morphology with an average size of about 2\u03bcm in edge length and 1\u20132\u03bcm in thickness. The elements Mn and Tb in TbMnO3 exist dominantly as Mn3+ and Tb3+, respectively. The magnetic measurements of the TbMnO3 powders exhibit antiferromagnetism. Because of the simplicity and generalizability of the MSS method, it is reasonable to expect that the MSS method could also be exploited in future works which involves the nanoscale investigation of ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and multiferroic materials.", "Double doped zinc oxide films with aluminum and hydrogen were prepared by the radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The structural, electrical, and optical properties of the films were investigated in terms of the annealing conditions to study the thermal stability. The electrical resistivity was significantly increased when the films were annealed at higher temperature in air atmosphere. The optical transmittance of the films changed very little but the optical band gap was reduced. The grain in the film became larger while the degree of c-axis orientation was decreased by the heat treatment. Although the thermal stability of the double doped zinc oxide films was worse than that of the aluminum doped zinc oxide films, the efficiency of amorphous silicon thin films solar cells fabricated on double doped zinc oxide film was improved.", "Laminated Ca(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3(CZN)-Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4(NZO) composites were prepared by the conventional solid-state sintering method. Compared with the common polycrystalline ceramics, the permeability of the CZN-NZO composites can be much enhanced by the laminated structure. Meanwhile, all the samples show excellent magneto-dielectric properties in a wide frequency range from 10MHz to 1GHz. The results indicate that this kind of magneto-dielectric composites can be used in the high frequency communications for the capacitor-inductor integrating devices such as miniaturized antennas, filters and electromagnetic interference suppression devices. The permeabilities of the laminated CZN-NZO composites are well fitted with the Maxwell-Garnett mixing law.", "Pure and V-doped NiTiO3 (NiTiO3:V) nanorods were synthesized via electrospinning synthesis using sol\u2013gel precursors, followed by sintering the samples at 600\u202f\u00b0C. And the subsequent Ag-loaded NiTiO3:V nanorods were prepared by the chemical precipitation method (Ag/NiTiO3:V). The phase formations were studied via X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements. The Rietveld refinements were conducted to investigate the structural characteristics. The surface property of the nanorods was measured via morphologies and X-ray photon spectrascope (XPS) measurements. The absorption spectra of products indicate sufficient optical response in visible wavelength region. The indirect allowed band gap (2.18\u202feV) of NiTiO3 originates from the characteristic charge-transfer (CT) transitions of O2\u2212\u202f\u2192\u202fTi4+ (UV region) and Ni2+\u202f\u2192\u202fTi4+ (visible light region). While Ag/NiTiO3:V composites have a smaller band energy of 2.09\u202feV. The photocatalytic activities were investigated by photo-degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye solutions under visible-light irradiation. The Ag/NiTiO3:V nanorods were efficient for the photo-degradation of RhB dye solutions. EIS measurements were used to analyze the charge-carrier migration at the interfaces. The improved photocatalysis of Ag/NiTiO3:V is ascribed to the narrowed band energy and enhanced efficiencies of the charge separations due to the Ag-coupling and V-doping in NiTiO3 lattices.", "Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) based piezoelectric ceramics with a composition of Pb1\u2212xLax(Zr1\u2212yTiy)0.975Nb0.025O3 where x=0.02\u20130.08 and y=0.45 were studied using conventional mixed-oxide route and sintered at 1270 \u00b0C. The specimens were fabricated and studied to understand the effect of Lanthanum substitution on the microstructure and the ferroelectric properties. The modified composition with 8 mol% of La3+ substitution has shown dielectric constant (\u03b5)=1978 at 1 kHz, planar coupling coefficient (Kp)\u22480.58 and loss factor (tan\u03b4)\u22480.014 at room temperature. Results revealed that La3+ substitution in Nb5+ doped PZT increases the dielectric and piezoelectric constants and reduces dielectric loss against La3+ free PZT-Nb5+ composition. The microstructural analysis of the modified composition shows the refinement of the grain in addition of La3+.", "Ferroelectric ceramics in the vicinity of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) with compositions represented as (1\u2212x)[(1\u2212y)(Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3)\u2013y(Pb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O3)]\u2013xPbTiO3 were prepared by solid state reaction. The addition of PYbN to PMN\u2013PT decreased the sintering temperature from 1200 \u00b0C (y=0.25) to 1000 \u00b0C (y=0.75). The PT content, where the MPB was observed, increased with the PYbN addition. A remanent polarization value of 28.5 \u00b5C/cm2 and a coercive field value of 11 kV/cm were measured from 0.62[0.25PMN\u20130.75PYbN]\u20130.38PT ceramics, which were close to the ones measured from PMN\u20130.32PT ceramics. In addition, the Curie temperature was found to increase with PYbN additions.", "Cu-ferrite films were deposited on glass substrates by RF-magnetron sputtering in pure Ar and mixture of (Ar+O2) environment. The XRD studies of the as-deposited films indicate nanocrystalline cubic spinel structure. The observed increase in the intensity of (400) line at the expense of (220) line with increase in O2 content is ascribed to the change in distribution of Cu and Fe-ions among tetrahedral A-site and octahedral B-sites. The highest saturation magnetization (MS) of 264 emu/cm3 (in-plane) and 188 emu/cm3 (out of-plane) was obtained for the as-deposited films in pure Ar. The high deposition rate in reducing atmosphere leads to the formation of Cu+ ions which prefer occupation of the A-site in the spinel structure displacing Fe3+ cations to occupy the B-sites giving rise to the change in cation distribution among A and B-sites and consequently leading to high value of MS. The decrease in MS value with increase in oxygen content is ascribed to the decrease in film growth rate and Cu+ concentration which allow the cations to take up their preferable sites. The observed change in the film properties with environment is due to the presence of multivalent copper and iron ions with differing site preferences.", "The coexistence of ultraviolet (UV) photoconductivity (PC) and room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) is observed in polycrystalline ZnO thin films deposited by unbalanced magnetron sputtering under high oxygen pressure. A significant increase in PC (\u223c870% to 40000%) is observed with increasing film thickness and the consequent structural disorder and film porosity. In contrast, the saturation magnetization (MS) at room temperature is found to decrease from 1.02emu/g to 0.53emu/g with increasing film thickness from 50 to 150nm.", "Multilayers (ML) of [SnO2/Mn]n and [SnO2/Co]n were fabricated by rf sputtering. The effect of spacer layer (SnO2) thickness, x on the optical properties of these ML was studied. The transmittance initially decreases as x increases from 12 to 24\u00c5 and then decreases as x increases to 36\u00c5. Similar trend is followed by band gap. For [SnO2/Mn] ML, it decreases from 4.47 to 3.16eV then increases to 4.28eV and for [SnO2/Co] ML, it decreases from 4.06 to 3.75eV then increases to 4.27eV as x changes from 12 to 36\u00c5. This variation is attributed to the quantum interference effects in the SnO2 layers. The ML with x=24\u00c5 is found to have low defect concentration compared to the ML with x=12 and 36\u00c5. The optical properties of the ML are more sensitive to the SnO2 layer thickness than that of Mn or Co. The variation of optical properties of the present ML is an artifact of the solubility limit of Mn or Co in the interface layers.", "Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B sintered magnets exhibit poor corrosion resistance due to the large electrochemical potential difference between the Nd2Fe14B matrix and the Nd-rich intergranular phase. This letter presents a new approach to improve corrosion resistance of (Pr,Nd)\u2013Fe\u2013B sintered magnets in both humid atmosphere and acidic environment through replacing the (Pr,Nd)-rich intergranular phase by a (Pr,Nd)6Fe13Cu one, which can reduce significantly the electrochemical potential difference. Mass loss for the restructured magnets is less than 1.0mg/cm2 after exposure to heat/humid atmosphere for 96h. Corrosion resistance in 0.005M H2SO4 solutions can also be significantly improved. In addition, the magnets still possess outstanding magnetic properties, with a maximum energy product (BH)max of ~384kJ/m3, demonstrating that the grain boundaries restructuring is a competitive method to fabricate corrosion-resistant Nd\u2013Fe\u2013B sintered magnets.", "LaMnO3 oxide was successfully synthesized from La(OH)3 and Mn2O3 precursors (molar ratio La/Mn=0.6) using the spark plasma sintering technique (SPS). The in-situ reaction proceeds in a few minutes at 900\u00b0C under 50MPa with the very high heating rate of 100\u00b0C/min. LaMnO3 powder was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and magnetic measurements. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray powder diffraction shows that LaMnO3 sample crystallizes in a perovskite structure O\u2032-type orthorhombic symmetry with Pbnm space group. Our sample undergoes an A-type antiferromagnetic order with N\u00e9el temperature equal to 138K. The magnetic susceptibility shows the Curie\u2013Weiss behavior between 170 and 320K with the effective magnetic moment \u03bceff=4.78\u03bcB/f.u and the Curie constant \u03b8P=\u221220K (antiferromagentic sign).", "Post thermal and plasma treatments are used to improve the morphology, optical and electrical properties of ZnO:Al (AZO) films prepared by DC-sputtering at room temperature. H-plasma treated sample exhibits the biggest surface roughness (Root Mean Square, RMS) of 6nm in all the samples. All the films show high transmittance above 90% in 400\u2013800nm visible range. The \u223c0.20eV blue-shift of the band gap is observed both in H2 annealed and H-plasma treated samples due to the defect and grain boundary passivation by hydrogen introduction. The improvement of the electrical properties is obvious except for 500\u00b0C O2 annealed sample (\u03c1=8.96\u00d710\u22122\u03a9cm, \u03bc=5.50cm2V\u22121S\u22121, and n=1.26\u00d71019cm\u22123) because of the extra oxygen substitution for vacancy oxygen (Vo) and the formation of oxides. The lowest resistivity (2.94\u00d710\u22123\u03a9cm) and highest mobility (12.00cm2V\u22121S\u22121) are obtained after H-plasma treatment. The significant increment of the carrier concentration indicates that hydrogen atoms have been injected to the lattice during H-plasma processing. Such good textured surface morphology and transparent conductive properties suggest that AZO films have potential possibilities in thin film silicon (TFS) solar cell for light trapping.", "Bi0.85Pr0.15Fe0.9Co0.1O3 (BPFCO) thin films were deposited on Pt(111)/TiO2/SiO2/Si(100) substrates, with SrRuO3 as buffer layer, by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. Polarization measurement of the unannealed film exhibited a clear double hysteresis loop with a large remnant polarization of 81\u03bcC/cm2. However, the double hysteresis loop phenomenon was suppressed in the BPFCO thin films annealed under pure oxygen atmosphere. The related mechanism for the appearance of double hysteresis loops was found to be due to defect dipoles associated with the oxygen vacancy. The magnetic property analysis presents further evidences for double hysteresis loop characteristic in the unannealed BPFCO thin films.", "Bi0.9La0.1Fe1\u2212xCrxO3 (x=0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) thin films were deposited on LaNiO3/Si and quartz by RF magnetron sputtering, respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that all phases belong to BiFeO3, and no secondary phase is detected. Three A1 modes and six E modes of the films are observed in Raman scattering spectra, and the A1-1 peak position shows red shift with the increasing of x, which indicates that the Cr doping induces more structural distortion. The band gap of the films for x=0.03, 0.05 and 0.07 can be expressed by (2.99\u2212x)eV, which is due to the Cr doping that increases the tailing of conduction band edge into the band gap. With the Cr content increasing from 3% to 7%, the remnant magnetization and the magnetization at 10kOe of the films show about 202% and 55% addition, respectively.", "AlN films doped with 1.2\u20137.9at% Mg were deposited by magnetron sputtering. Ferromagnetism is observed in the film with Tc over 380K, and it strongly depends on the Mg concentration. The observed magnetic anisotropy and exclusion of ferromagnetic contamination enforce the assumption for the origin of the intrinsic property in Mg-doped AlN films. The results confirmed that the room temperature ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductor can be realized by doping the nonmagnetic element Mg.", "Influence of nitrogen fractions[Nf=N2/(N2+Ar2)] on the structural and magnetic properties of Mn3NiNx thin films prepared on quartz substrates using magnetron sputtering have been studied. The N/Ni ratio increased (N/Ni=0.3\u20131.1) while the peak (200) shifted to lower angles with increasing Nf. It revealed that there was significant variation in the preferred orientation and N\u00e9el temperature (TN) for the films with increasing Nf. Strong indication for a frozen state is found, determined from the difference between field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetizations. The ac susceptibility measurements show a peak position shifting as a function of the driving frequency f and magnetization value does not saturate in the field range. These findings consistently demonstrate that Mn3NiNx thin films exhibit a spin-glass state at low temperature.", "A series of BiFeO3 thin films were prepared on SrRuO3-buffered (100) YAlO3, (La, Sr)(Al, Ta)O3, SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 single-crystal oxide substrates via radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. An excellent (00l)-oriented growth of BiFeO3 films with a dominant rhombohedral-like phase was identified by XRD analyses. The electrical properties, e.g. dielectric, ferroelectric and leakage current characteristics, of BiFeO3 films grown on these single-crystal substrates showed significant differences. It was found that the BiFeO3 film deposited on LaAlO3 substrate exhibited the best overall electrical properties among the four films. It showed low loss tangent (tan\u03b4<0.05) and leakage current density (J<8\u00d710\u22124A/cm2), as well as a remnant polarization of 2Pr~150\u03bcC/cm2 and a reduced coercive field of 2Ec~340kV/cm.", "Ge doped Cu3SbSe4 semiconductors with Cu deficiencies were synthesized by melting and spark plasma sintering for the investigation of their thermoelectric transport properties. Ge atoms can successfully substitute Sb lattice sites, and result in lattice shrinkage with increasing Ge content. Doping with Ge not only improves the electrical conductivity but also optimizes the power factor of Cu2.95(Sb1\u2212xGex)Se4. Ge doped specimens also reveal a competition between alloying effects and increased carrier thermal conductivity. The zT enhancement of Ge doped alloys is mainly ascribed to the enhanced power factor and the reduced lattice thermal conductivity. As a result, Cu2.95(Sb0.96Ge0.04)Se4 reaches a maximum zT of 0.7 at 640K, showing an approximately 35% enhancement over the pristine Cu2.95SbSe4.", "Si-based tandem solar cells have emerged as a promising alternative to replace the current high efficiency silicon single junction solar cells. Sb2S3 is a promising candidates for top cell absorbers due to its suitable band gap, non-toxic and earth-abundant constituent, simple composition, and long term stability. Here, in situ growth of Sb2S3 thin films by radio frequency (RF) reactive sputtering on n-Si(100) substrates is reported. The effects of the growth temperature on morphology, structure, optical and electrical properties of the films were evaluated. The top sub-cell device shows an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 367mV, indicating the potential to be the top cell of the next generation Si-based tandem solar cells.", "This paper reported a method to increase the maximum energy products of MnAl thin films through magnetic exchange coupling. MnAl and MnAl/FeCo thin films were deposited through DC magnetron sputtering on Si wafer substrate. The morphology of the thin films was investigated through SEM, TEM and AFM, and the magnetic properties were investigated through VSM. Results show that there is an effective magnetic exchange coupling between MnAl and FeCo thin films when the FeCo layer is no larger than 8nm. The magnetic exchange coupling was demonstrated by smooth magnetic hysteresis loops, enhanced maximum energy products, and positive peaks in the Henkel Plots. The results reported in this paper could be used to further increase the magnetic performance of MnAl thin films.", "The p-type high insulating thin films were obtained by doping Mg into \u03b2-Ga2O3. Thin films with various Mg concentrations were deposited on (0001) c-plane Al2O3 substrate by radio frequency magnetron sputtering followed by post-annealing treatment. The crystal structure expanded due to the substitution of the trivalent Ga3+ with the divalent Mg2+ in a larger ion radius. The Fermi level (EF) of the Mg doped film is closer to the valence band, exhibiting a characteristic of weak p-type. The Mg doped Ga2O3 thin films were used to construct the metal/semiconductor/metal (MSM) structure, and the devices showed a high resistance (4.1pA at 10V), a high sensitivity (8.7\u00d7105%), a high responsivity (23.8mA/W) and a short decay time (0.02s) under 254nm UV light irradiation, suggesting a potential application in solar-blind photodetector.", "The growth of gallium nitride nanowires on c-plane sapphire substrates using binary catalytic alloy was investigated by manipulating growth time and precursor-to-substrate distance. The variations in structural, optical and morphological behaviour of the samples at different growth conditions were observed using X-ray diffractometer, cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It was noticed that, thickness of the nanowires decreased with increase in growth time and precursor-to-substrate distance. Simultaneously, length of the nanowires increased with growth time and varied with precursor-to-substrate distance. The reduction in nanowire thickness was found to have a positive effect in improving luminescence property and bandgap of the grown nanowires. The results indicate that this material system can be catered for optoelectronic device applications.", "Porous ZnO thin films were obtained from the ZnO target by r.f. Magnetron sputtering onto glass and intrinsic-Silicon (100) substrates at different substrate temperatures (473K and 673K) and at a fixed combined partial pressure 5Pa of Ar+O 2 and at a fixed sputtering power of 50W. The composition of the films deposited at 473K reveals that the films were oxygen deficient. The structural study reveals that the films were highly c-axis oriented with wurtzite ZnO phase. The predominant peak is (002) with a significant shift in the peak position towards lower 2\u03b8 value. The surface morphological features reveal that the film surface is porous when deposited at lower substrate temperatures of 473K. The average pore size is 82nm. The evaluated optical energy gap of the films is 3.1eV and increases to 3.14eV when deposited at higher substrate temperature.", "Calcium Bismuth Titanate (CBTi) ceramics were prepared by solid state reaction method and sintered in microwave heating process from 1050\u00b0C \u2013 1200\u00b0C for 20 min. The formation of single phase with Orthorhombic structure was verified by X-Ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The orthorhombic distortion present in the CBTi ceramic sintered at 1150\u00b0C was found to be maximum. The plate like morphology of the surface of the samples is observed in FE-SEM. The dielectric properties were measured at room temperature with Impedance Analyser. The ceramics sintered at 1150\u00b0C for 20 min. in microwave furnace show superior dielectric properties than 1200\u00b0C in conventional furnace for 2 hrs. The dielectric constants varies from 125-212 at 3KHz and losses are minimum. The presence of large orthorhombic distortion in the CBTi ceramics sintered at 1150\u00b0C results in high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss. The observed results indicate the importance of orthorhombic distortion and microwave sintering in enhancing the dielectric properties of a ferroelectric material.", "Photo papers are very light weight, cheapest easily available and compatible with the roll-to-roll printing process. Here we report hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films deposited on photo paper by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (rf-PECVD) technique. A series of intrinsic a-Si-H thin films were deposited by varying the substrate temperature (Ts) between 70 \u00b0C \u2013 150 \u00b0C. Raman measurement atdifferent positions on the film corresponds to multiphase (amorphous as well as nanocrystalline phase) nature of films. The film having nanocrystalline phase, exhibit higher bandgap and higher photosensitivity (\u223c 6 orders of magnitude) as compared to films with pure amorphous phase. The optoelectronic properties of these films are comparable to those on conventional corning 1737 glass substrate.", "Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) deposited by pulsed DC magnetron sputtering technique as the gate dielectric for 4H-SiC based metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure has been investigated. A rectifying current\u2013voltage characteristic was observed, with the injection of current occurred when a positive DC bias was applied to the gate electrode with respect to the n type 4H-SiC substrate. This undesirable behavior is attributed to the relatively small band gap of Ta2O5 of around 4.3eV, resulting in a small band offset between the 4H-SiC and Ta2O5. To overcome this problem, a thin thermal silicon oxide layer was introduced between Ta2O5 and 4H-SiC. This has substantially reduced the leakage current through the MIS structure. Further improvement was obtained by annealing the Ta2O5 at 900\u00b0C in oxygen. The annealing has also reduced the effective charge in the dielectric film, as deduced from high frequency C\u2013V measurements of the Ta2O5/SiO2/4H-SiC capacitors.", "The effects of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) temperature on the properties of the In2O3 thin films deposited on glass substrate by reactive magnetron sputtering were investigated. The thin films were annealed at various RTA temperatures for 1min and characterized for their structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties. The experimental results showed that the postgrowth RTA temperature has a significant effect on the properties of the In2O3 thin films. The preferred orientation along (222) plane and an increase in average grain size by 10nm were observed with increasing the RTA temperature. The average optical transmittance in the wavelength range of 370\u20131100nm was increased from 86.7% to 88.6% after annealing at 600\u00b0C, where the highest value of the figure of merit was obtained. In addition to the increase in carrier concentration, a higher RTA temperature caused the band gap energy of the thin films to rise linearly.", "Titanium dioxide thin films were grown by sol\u2013gel technique in order to obtain films to be used in photocatalytic reactions. We present results on the structural and optical characterization measured for series of films in which number of layers and sintering temperature were changed. Using X-ray diffraction we have characterized the crystalline phase in the films depending on the growth conditions and by using the spectrophotometer we characterized the resulting bandgap energy. The results on the photocatalytic activity were obtained by immersing these films in a methylene blue solution with the presence of ultraviolet light, which is a standard used to characterize the efficiency of the reaction. High bactericidal activity with these films in wastewater samples was observed subtracting the action of used ultraviolet light, through gas evolution measurements using photoacoustic (PA) technique.", "Nanoparticle samples of Ni0.5Co0.5 \u2212 2 x Lix Fe2+ x O4 (x =0.05\u20130.25) have been prepared by using citrate precursor method. The powders have been divided equally into two groups; one group has been sintered at 600\u00b0C for 2h to keep the size of the particles at the nano scale. The other group has been sintered at 1115\u00b0C for the same duration to prompt the growth of the particles to the bulk size. The effect of increasing Li1+ and Fe3+ ions on the expense of Co2+ ions onmicrostructure andsome magnetic properties has been studied for the two groups. For that purpose, X-ray diffraction XRD, transmission electron microscopy TEM, Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer VSM have been used to investigate the samples. Moreover, the effect of varying the pH of the solution during the preparation procedure on different properties has been investigated for one composition; that is, for the sample of x =0.05. The XRD analysis has confirmed the formation of the required samples, while TEM images have been used to check up the average size of the particles of two selected samples only. FTIR spectra have revealed the presence of two prominent absorption bands v 1 and v 2 around 600cm\u22121 and 400cm\u22121 which are usually attributed to the tetrahedral and octahedral complexes in the spinel lattice, respectively. The magnetic measurements may be explained on the basis of a suggested cation distribution although they may be slightly affected by many other factors.", "TiW films were deposited onto glass substrates and GaN epitaxial layers by RF magnetron sputtering. It was found that TiW film deposited with a 300W RF power could provide us a high transmittance and a low resistivity. GaN-based ultraviolet metal\u2013semiconductor\u2013metal (MSM) photodetectors were also fabricated. It was found that photocurrent to dark current contrast ratios were 4.35, 4.6 \u00d7 102 and 5.7 \u00d7 104 for the photodetectors with ITO, TiN, and TiW electrodes, respectively. The large photocurrent to dark current contrast ratio could be attributed mainly to the fact that TiW can form a high Schottky barrier height on the surface of u-GaN epitaxial layers.", "The cofiring behavior, interfacial structure and cofiring migration between NiCuZn ferrite and lead magnesium niobate (PMN)-based relaxor ferroelectric materials were investigated via thermomechanical analyzer (TMA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Mismatched sintering shrinkage between NiCuZn ferrite and PMN was modified by adding an appropriate amount of sintering aids, Bi2O3, into NiCuZn ferrite. Pyrochlore phase appeared in the mixture of NiCuZn ferrite and PMN, which is detrimental to the final electric properties of LC filters. EDS results indicated that the interdiffusion at the heterogeneous interfaces in the composites, such as Fe, Pb, Zn, existed which can strengthen combinations between ferrite layers and ferroelectrics layers.", "Titanium dioxide is among the few semiconductors that have good chemical/photochemical stabilities and high oxidation power. However, its relatively high band gap makes it only effective when exposed under UV light. It has been found that the addition of transition metals to TiO2 can improve the photocatalytic activity by UV irradiation and extend its use in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, the reactive magnetron sputtering method was used to prepare pure and Fe-doped titanium dioxide thin films. The films were deposited onto microscope glass slides and polycarbonate plates at different total pressures and iron-doping concentrations. The morphology of the films was analysed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and their structure by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effect of Fe-doping and total sputtering pressure on the photocatalytic activity, was evaluated by measuring the degradation rates of the rhodamine-B (RhB) dye under UV irradiation. The experimental results show that the deposited TiO2 films on the glass substrate were of the anatase phase with a \u3008004\u3009 preferred orientation. On contrary, for TiO2 films deposited on the polycarbonate substrate only an amorphous structure was obtained. The crystallite sizes of the films were 4.1 and 7.1nm for TiO2 films deposited at total sputtering pressures of 0.4 and 0.5Pa, respectively. The iron doped films resulted in the light absorbance shifting to the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. In general, iron doping led to a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 films deposited on both substrates. However, the highest photodegradation rates were obtained for films deposited on the polymer substrate under the lower total pressure of 0.4Pa.", "The (Zn0.91Mn0.09)O thin film annealed at 1000\u00b0C for 60min in N2 atmosphere showed two kinds of Curie temperature (TC) values of TC1 around 130K and TC2 above 300K while the as-grown (Zn0.91Mn0.09)O thin film showed typical ferromagnetism with the TC of 108K. It is expected that the increase of TC up to TC1 might be attributed to the enhancement of crystal magnetic anisotropy because the increases of (000l) peak for X-ray diffraction patterns and Mn2+-related emission for photoluminescence spectra were observed for annealed (Zn0.91Mn0.09)O thin films. The increase of TC above TC2 might be originated from the formation of nano-sized (Zn0.91Mn0.09)O islands because it was confirmed that the nano-sized (Zn0.91Mn0.09)O islands were formed after annealing treatment and that they revealed clearly the magnetic domains at 300K for the measurements of atomic force microscopy and magnetic force microscopy, respectively. The room temperature ferromagnetism in the nano-sized (Zn0.91Mn0.09)O islands is considered to be originated from the inhomogeneous distribution of Mn ions.", "Fine powders of Ni0.6\u2212xCuxZn0.4Fe2O4, where 0\u2264x\u22640.4 was prepared by the citrate precursor method. The powders were calcined at 600\u00b0C for a duration of 1h and sintered at 900\u00b0C for 3h. The effect of compositional variation on structural, dielectric and magnetic properties of the Cu substituted NiZn ferrite was investigated. X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the formation of single-phase cubic spinel structure at such low temperature of calcinations and sintering. A maximum density of 4.7g/cm3 was obtained for the Cu substituted ferrite. The grain sizes were estimated from the SEM micrographs. The addition of copper promoted grain growth, resulting in increase in grain size. Curie temperature, however, was understandably lowered with the increase in Cu content. A saturation magnetization value of 92emu/g was obtained for the composition x=0.2. This value is higher than that reported for ferrites prepared by the conventional ceramic method. Ferrite with Cu concentration of x=0.4, showed the highest value of initial permeability.", "High-temperature superconducting (HTS) maglev vehicle is well known as one of the most potential applications of bulk high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs) in transported levitation system. Many efforts have promoted the practice of the HTS maglev vehicle in people's life by enhancing the load capability and stability. Besides improving the material performance of bulk HTSC and optimizing permanent magnet guideway (PMG), magnetization method of bulk HTSC is also very effective for more stable levitation. Up to now, applied onboard bulk HTSCs are directly magnetized by field cooling above the PMG for the present HTS maglev test vehicles or prototypes in China, Germany, Russia, Brazil, and Japan. By the direct-field-cooling-magnetization (DFCM) over PMG, maglev performances of the bulk HTSCs are mainly depended on the PMG's magnetic field. However, introducing HTS bulk magnet into the HTS maglev system breaks this dependence, which is magnetized by other non-PMG magnetic field. The feasibility of this HTS bulk magnet for maglev vehicle is investigated in the paper. The HTS bulk magnet is field-cooling magnetized by a Field Control Electromagnets Workbench (FCEW), which produces a constant magnetic field up to 1T. The levitation and guidance forces of the HTS bulk magnet over PMG with different trapped flux at 15mm working height (WH) were measured and compared with that by DFCM in the same applied PMG magnetic field at optimal field-cooling height (FCH) 30mm, WH 15mm. It is found that HTS bulk magnet can also realize a stable levitation above PMG. The trapped flux of HTS bulk magnet is easily controllable by the charging current of FCEW, which implies the maglev performances of HTS bulk magnet above PMG will be adjustable according to the practical requirement. The more trapped flux HTS bulk magnet will lead to bigger guidance force and smaller repulsion levitation force above PMG. In the case of saturated trapped flux for experimental HTS bulk magnet, it is not effective to improve its maglev performances by increasing of charging magnetic field, when the guidance force at WH 15mm is 5.7 times larger than that by DFCM of FCH 30mm. So introducing HTS bulk magnet into the present maglev system is feasible and more controllable to realize stable levitation above applied PMG, which is an important alternative for the present HTS maglev vehicle.", "A composite system BaTiO3 (x)\u2013BaFe12O19 (1\u2212x) with ferroelectric BaTiO3 phase (BT) and a ferrimagnetic BaFe12O19 phase (BF), in which x varies from 0.8 to 0.6, have been prepared by solid state double sintering method. The presence of ferroelectric (BT) and ferrimagnetic phase (BF) have been confirmed from X-ray diffraction analysis, indicating the formation of composite system. Microstructure observation shows the distribution of BT and BF grains with respect to different compositions. With the variation of x in the composite system, a typical magnetic hysteresis loops have been observed at room temperature with high magnetization and coercivity values. The ferroelectric measurements have displayed hysteresis loops for x=0.8 and 0.6 compositions. Magnetoelectric (ME) output have been recorded at room temperature for the both the compositions. The in situ magnetic field pressing at different magnetic fields followed by solid state sintering has enhanced the ME output value. Quadratic magnetoelectric signal is recorded indicating non-linearity in the system.", "Cobalt-doped ZnO nanorods were successfully synthesized on Si/SiO2 substrate using RF-magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The undoped and Co-doped ZnO nanostructures were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, AFM, and PL spectra. The results showed that Co2+ replaced Zn2+ in the ZnO lattice without changing the wurtzite structure. The ZnO structure became high crystallite and was gradually converted into nanorods without extra phases as increased cobalt doping levels to 3at.% and 4at.%. The as-synthesized nanorod arrays were dense and vertically grew on the substrate with lengths of approximately 341 and 382.3nm for 3at.% and 4at.% CO, respectively. PL analysis revealed that the ultraviolet (UV) emission intensity decreased and exhibited a blue shift with increased Co atomic percentage. This result was consistent with the energy bandgap values (3.26\u20133.3eV) obtained from UV\u2013vis spectra. The I\u2013V characteristics revealed that the Shottky diodes based on Co-doped ZnO nanostructure with Pd electrodes have high barrier height (0.715\u20130.797eV) and low saturation current (0.035\u20130.841\u03bcA). The barrier height decreased after annealing the diodes at 500\u00b0C for 2h. To the best of our knowledge, Schottky diodes based on Co-doped ZnO nanorods prepared by RF-magnetron sputtering have not yet been reported.", "0.55Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O3\u20130.45PbTiO3 high-TC piezoelectric ceramics have been sintered respectively by the conventional process and the microwave sintering method, and the dependence of the microstructure, ferroelectric, dielectric and piezoelectric properties on the two sintering approaches has been studied. In comparison with the conventional sintering method, the optimal sintering temperature of the microwave sintering process is lower and its holding time is shorter. Specimen sintered at 1050\u00b0C by the microwave sintering process has higher density, smaller average grain size, higher spontaneous polarization and larger piezoelectric constant (d33) than those of sample sintered at 1150\u00b0C in the muffle furnace. When sintered at 1050\u00b0C by the microwave sintering method, the density of the sample reaches 98.8% of the theoretical density, and the d33 of the specimens is as high as 293pC/N. The results indicate that the microwave sintering process is an effective method to fabricate the high-TC piezoelectric ceramics for practical applications.", "The Ni0.15Mg0.1Cu0.3Zn0.45Fe2O4 ferrite powders have been prepared by NaOH co-precipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The XRD patterns confirm the single phase spinel structure of synthesized nanoparticles. The average crystallite size of the particles increases from 12 to 36nm with calcining temperature (Ta) from 500 to 800\u00b0C. The saturation magnetization (Ms) of the superparamagnetic particles was deduced by Langevin theory. Subsequently, the densification characteristics and magnetic properties of the low-temperature 950\u00b0C-sintered ferrite bulk samples were also investigated. The magnetic measurement showed that the sintered bulk sample of Ta=600\u00b0C has the highest initial permeability (\u03bci), lowest coercivity (Hc), largest saturation magnetization (Ms) and satisfactory thermal stability of \u03bci. The microstructures of sintered samples were examined using field emission scanning electric microscope (FESEM). The Ta has significant influence on the bulk density, initial permeability, saturation magnetization and coercivity of Ni0.15Mg0.1Cu0.3Zn0.45Fe2O4 ferrite.", "Optical studies of Bx Ga1\u2212x As/GaAs epilayers grown by Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), with boron composition \u22647%, have been achieved by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) as a function of the excitation density and the sample temperature (10\u2013300 K). The Raman scattering have shown a linear variation between boron composition and Raman shift of the optical phonons modes. It has shown that the BGaAs PL band shifts to low energy side when the boron composition is \u22642.5% compared to the GaAs one. But this band increases slowly as the boron content increases in range 2.5% to 7%. Blue shifts of the PL bands were observed when increasing the excitation density. The temperature dependence of the PL peak energy has shown an S-shaped behavior. Based on these experimental results, we have suggested that the carrier recombination mechanisms in the BGaAs epilayer result from exciton-localization like mode. These experimental results show that boron incorporation does not cause a great modification of the band structure in Bx Ga1\u2212x As alloys compared to the pure GaAs.", "Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a proper scaffold for bone repair, however, it is not of excellent mechanical properties. Most previous studies on the effect of temperature increases were in vitro and had assessed merely improvements of HA's physicomechanical quality. This in vitro/vivo study investigated the effect of temperature increases from 870 to 920\u00b0C on physicomechanical and biological quality of Nano-HA. Forty experimentally produced HA disks sintered at 870 to 920\u00b0C were prepared (n=20\u00d72). Disks were subjected to Vickers microindentation test (1 disk from each group divided into 4 quarters), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (1 disk), X-ray diffraction (XRD) [1 disk together with non-sintered HA], field emission scanning electron microscopy (FSEM, 1 disk from each group together with non-sintered HA), cell seeding and SEM assessment (2 disks), MTT assay over 4 different time periods (16 quadrants of 4 disks from each group), 6 one-thirds of 2 disks from each group for immunocytochemical (ICC) assay, and 8 disks from each group [as well as non-sintered HA] for the animal study (implantation in 4 sockets in 8 rabbits [32 specimens], histomorphometry, and computerized tomography) over two time periods. Quantitative data were analyzed statistically (\u03b1=0.05). Vickers microhardness increased from 63.7\u00b111.9 in the 870 group to 153.4\u00b1104.7 in the 920 group (P=0.057). XRD indicated more regular crystal patterns in sintered groups compared to non-sintered nanoHA. FSEM showed larger crystals in the 920 group compared to 870 and non-sintered nanoHA. Expression of osteocalcin, osteonectin, and RUNX2 genes were more visible in ICC samples of the 920HA group. In MTT, cell numbers increased in all groups significantly (P=0.000), with no between-group differences (P>0.3). In rabbit experiments, the extent of \u2018newly formed bone\u2019 increased significantly over time (two-way ANOVA, P=0.000), reaching 39.5%, 46.4%, and 77.5% in the groups non-sintered HA, 870, and 920, respectively. The 920\u00b0C-sintered nanoHA induced the highest bone formation (P=0.000). Increasing the temperature of nanoHA sintering from 870 to 920\u00b0C can improve its physicomechanical properties and bone formation potential.", "It has been proposed that silicon nanoclusters embedded in silicon-rich oxide (SRO) can trap one electron, or one hole. Also, it has been suggested that embedded nanoclusters can be classified into interface and bulk nanoclusters. The possibility of using the characteristic of one electron trapping property in new devices is now under intensive research. In this paper, the charging and discharging properties of silicon-rich oxide layer were studied using an Al/SRO/Si MOS-like structure. The SRO layer was deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition, and half of the samples were thermally annealed at 1100\u00b0C in N2 ambient. The measured I\u2013V characteristics show clear current peaks and valleys in low voltage regime. This extraordinary behavior is ascribed to the charge exchange between the embedded nanoclusters in SRO layer and the Si substrate. The valence band of the nanoclusters is supposed to play an important role during the charging and discharging process. C\u2013V measurements were also performed in order to clarify the results. The effect of thermal annealing was explored.", "Single junction a-Si:H solar cell using oxide based window and buffer layer was fabricated by using a conventional plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. The impact of oxide based window layers and the effect of oxide buffer layer thickness on light induced degradation are investigated. Solar cells with optimized oxide based window and buffer layers have been fabricated with an optical gap of 1.97eV and 1.86eV. On comparing these solar cells with carbide based window and buffer layers, it is found that light induced degradation (LID) of oxide based cells is almost 4% less than the carbide based ones. Oxide based cells show significant improvement in quantum efficiency for lower wavelength region, compared to carbide based cells. Stabilized efficiency after 1000h light soaking for the oxide and carbide based solar cells is found to be 7.55% and 6.50%, respectively.", "We have developed a highly-sensitive transient photocapacitance measurement (TPM) system for deep defects in wide bandgap materials, and applied it to characterize the boron-doped diamond films grown on a high-pressure/high-temperature-synthesized Ib diamond substrate using high-power-density microwave-plasma chemical vapor deposition method. The developed TPM system has both a low detection limit of less than 0.5 fF for changes in the photocapacitance and a low measurement temperature drift of less than 0.03K in 12h. By using the TPM system, we have successfully found an acceptor-type defect around 1.2eV above the valence-band maximum for the B-doped diamond film with a considerably high crystalline quality that had some strong exciton emission peaks in the cathodoluminescence spectra taken at \u224880K. The photoionization cross section and the defect density estimated for the observed defect were 3.1\u00d710\u201315cm2 and 2.8\u00d71016cm\u22123, respectively.", "In this research, TiO2 thin films prepared via thermal oxidation of Ti layers were deposited by RF-magnetron sputtering method at three different sputtering powers. The effects of sputtering power on structure, surface and optical properties of TiO2 thin films grown on glass substrate were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopic (AFM) and UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer. The results reveal that, the structure of layers is changed from amorphous to crystalline at anatase phase by thermal oxidation of deposited Ti layers and rutile phase is formed when sputtering power is increased. The optical parameters: absorption coefficient, dielectric constants, extinction coefficient, refractive index, optical conductivity and dissipation factor are decreased with increase in sputtering power, but increase in optical band gap is observed. The roughness of thin films surface is affected by changes in sputtering power which is obtained by AFM images.", "In the current research, we report the synthesis of CuO nanoparticles using dc reactive magnetron sputtering technique at various sputtering pressure (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50mTorr) and their structural, thermal and optical properties. The characterization of the synthesized CuO nanoparticles was carried using powder XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR, FE-SEM, EDX, TEM, TGA and UV\u2013vis DRS. XRD results exhibited the monoclinic phase of CuO nanoparticles and the crystallite size increases with increase in sputtering pressure. The EDX and Raman analysis confirm the formation of high purity CuO nanoparticles. The particle size of synthesized nanoparticles was calculated using TEM analysis. The FE-SEM and TEM results show spherical morphology in aggregated form. TGA results reveal that nanoparticles are purely hydrous and weight loss was inversely correlated to the particle size. UV-DRS results indicated that the band gap energy decreased with increase of sputtering pressure due to increase in particle size.", "Thin films of (Ta2O5)0.85(TiO2)0.15 were prepared on p-Si and quartz substrates by reactive magnetron sputtering and the influence of substrate bias voltage (V\n                     \n                        b\n                     ) on their structural and electrical properties was studied. The crystal structure of the prepared films was elucidated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The structure of the as deposited films was found to be amorphous and the surface roughness of the films was found to be low. The crystallinity of the films was observed to be improved by increasing the substrate bias voltage. The XPS results revealed that the composition of the films were nearly stoichiometric with V\n                     \n                        b\n                      at 0V and \u2212150V. The optical properties of the films at various substrate bias voltages were also studied. The optical band gap of the films formed at various V\n                     \n                        b\n                      values from 0 to \u2212150V decreased from 4.49 to 4.39eV as revealed from the optical transmission spectra. The fabricated Al/(Ta2O5)0.85(TiO2)0.15/p-Si metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) Schottky diodes leakage currents at \u22121.5V decreased from 4.65 \u00d7 10\u22126\n                     A (unbiased) to 3.73 \u00d7 10\u22128\n                     A (V\n                     \n                        b\n                      = \u2212100V). On the other hand, the sample biased at V\n                     \n                        b\n                     = \u2212150 V exhibited an increase in leakage current (2.99 \u00d7 10\u22124\n                     A) when compared to all other prepared samples. Furthermore, the electrical parameters such as Schottky barrier height and ideality factor were calculated for the Al/(Ta2O5)0.85(TiO2)0.15/p-Si MIS Schottky structure and systematically investigated as a function of substrate bias voltage using current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics.", "(Ba0.7Ca0.3)Ti1-xMgxO3-x ceramics where x=0, 0.005, 0.015 and 0.02 were prepared employing a solid state sintering technique. The abrupt decrease of tetragonality was induced by doping with x\u22650.015. Ti K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) spectra indicated spontaneous polarization weakness of doped ceramics. The grain size was decreased due to the creation of oxygen vacancies and solute-drag effect. The reduction of the phase transition temperature, ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity was observed in correlation with the decrease in tetragonality. Dielectric properties near room temperature of the samples could be enhanced with Mg addition. The results here suggested that the electrical properties of this ceramic may be largely tunable by Mg dopant and could be an attractive material for high-dielectric response devices.", "Triode sputtering is used to fabricate polarizing monochromators and supermirrors for neutrons with high quality. X-ray, polarized neutron scattering, in situ ellipsometry and SQUID are used to investigate the growth of sputtered FeCo\u2013Si multilayer to determine the crystallization and its influence on magnetic properties. The surface energy during the layer deposition is found to have the most important influence on crystallinity. High energy on the substrate achieved with argon bombardment at a substrate bias potential of \u221270V produces a pronounced crystallinity of Fe89Co11 layers and facilitates chemical bond in the interface. On the contrary low energy on substrate under bias potential +100V and floating results in low crystallinity and no chemical bond. In a XRD study on monochromators deposited at a bias potential of \u221270V, the (110) plane of Fe89Co11 is observed with nearly hundredfold intensity compared to the one with bias potential of +100V or floating potential. In addition, the magnetic properties of the monochromators are influenced with the bias voltage as well. The minus bias potential leads to high coercivity but reduced remanence compared with floating. The monochromator with a positive bias potential of +100V shows distinct magnetic anisotropy and in its soft direction a magnetic remanence of 94%.", "Non-magnetic neutron guides are needed where polarized neutrons are to be transmitted. Mirrotron Ltd. is able to produce guides of standard length and width coated with non-magnetic Ni(Mo)/Ti supermirrors. Hot-pressed and vacuum-melted Ni(Mo) targets were tried out for the sputtering process. High-quality Ni(Mo)/Ti supermirrors with various critical angles were produced. The reflectivity at the critical angle was 0.97, 0.95, 0.92, 0.9 and 0.85 for m 1.2, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3, respectively. The non-magnetic properties of the mirrors were proved at HMI using polarized neutrons.", "Magnetic nanoparticles are fabricated in silica glass (SiO2) using high-flux implantation of 60 keV negative nickel ions Ni\u2212. Photo-absorption measurements and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) observation confirm the formation of metallic Ni nanoparticles in SiO2, and exclude the possible formation of Ni silicides (Ni3Si, Ni2Si, NiSi) and oxides (NiO) as major products. The mean diameter of the nanoparticles was \u223c2.9 nm, and the observed depth distribution was similar to a prediction from the TRIDYN code when sputtering was accounted for. Temperature- and field-dependences of magnetization show that the nanoparticles are in the superparamagnetic state at T\u223c50 K. From the peak temperature of the zero-field cooling (ZFC) magnetization, which is \u223c27 K, and the mean diameter determined from XTEM, it is suggested that the magnetic anisotropy constant K of the nanoparticles is enhanced by \u223c8 times as compared to the bulk value.", "Calculations of the ionization probabilities of Ag\u2212 and Au\u2212 particles, ejected during sputtering of clean Ag(100) and Au(100) surfaces, respectively, are reported. An effective one-electron theory is used to describe: the plane metal surface, with a projected band gap, the secondary emitted atom, whose charge state is investigated, and its nearest-neighbor substrate atom, put in motion by the collision cascade generated by the primary ion beam. Suitable rectilinear trajectories are selected to describe the motion of these two atoms outside the solid. A good agreement is found with van Der Heide\u2019s experiments (P.A.W. van Der Heide, Nucl. Instr. and Meth. B 157 (1999) 126).", "FIB applications like writing ion implantation, ion beam mixing or ion beam synthesis in the \u03bcm- or nm range often require ion species other than gallium. Therefore alloy liquid metal ion sources (LMIS) have to be developed and applied in FIB tools. The energy distribution of ions emitted from an alloy LMIS is one of the crucial parameters for the performance of a FIB column. Different source materials like AuGe, AuSi, AuGeSi, CoNd, ErNi, ErFeNiCr, MnGe, GaBi, GaBiLi, SnPb,\u2026 were investigated with respect to the energy spread of the different ion species as a function of emission current, ion mass and emitter temperature. Different alloy LMIS\u2019s have been developed and used in the FZD \u2013 FIB system especially for writing implantation to fabricate sub-\u03bcm pattern without any lithographic steps. Co and various other ion species were applied to generate CoSi2 nano-structures, like dots and wires by ion beam synthesis or to manipulate the properties of magnetic films. Additionally, the possibility of varying the flux in the FIB by changing the pixel dwell-time can be used for the investigation of the radiation damage and dynamic annealing in Si, Ge and SiC at elevated implantation temperatures. Furthermore, a broad spectrum of ions was employed to study in a fast manner the sputtering process depending on temperature, angle of incidence and ion mass on a couple of target materials. These studies are important for the 3D-fabrication of various kinds of micro-tools by FIB milling.", "The n-type GaN film was grown on sapphire substrate by metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). Mn+ ions of 75keV with the fluence of 8\u00d71017/cm2 were implanted in the GaN at 350\u00b0C. The implanted sample was annealed at 850\u00b0C to recrystallize the sample and to remove implantation damage. We investigated the structural and magnetic properties of Mn+ ion-implanted GaN by using Rutherford back-scattering (RBS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). RBS results showed the Mn+ ions were concentrated near the surface. HRTEM results showed nano-clusters structure in the sample. The temperature dependence of magnetization taken in zero-field-cooling and field-cooling conditions with the block temperature was 267K and hysteresis loops which exhibited a transformation from ferromagnetism to superparamagnetism showed the features of magnetic nano-clusters system. And it could be explained the magnetic property of this film originated from Mn-rich clusters.", "Sputter deposited(Ni 80 Fe 20-2nm / Au-2nm / Co-t Co/ Au-2nm) 10 multilayers are characterized by alternating in-plane(Ni 80 Fe 20)and out-of-plane (for Co thickness in the range0.3 t Co 1.2nm ) magnetic anisotropy. The magnetic properties of the samples, before and after ion bombardment, were characterized by magnetometric and magnetoresistive measurements. The irradiation process was performed with fluences of 30keV He + ions varied in the range 10 13\u2a7d D \u2a7d 3 \u00d710 16He +/cm 2. We report that for fluences in the range between 10 15 and 10 16He +/cm 2 the effective (perpendicular) anisotropy of the Co layer decreases noticeably. The origin of the effect is related to a reduction in the surface anisotropy thus to interfaces modification. As a consequence strong reduction of magnetoresistance was also observed.", "Wide bandgap semiconductor materials provide superior electrical, optical, and thermal properties that classical semiconductors, Si and GaAs, are unable to achieve. However, most commercially available substrates have large lattice and thermal expansion mismatches to III-nitrides films. Thus a high quality buffer layer, grown at low temperatures, is essential in growing high quality III-nitride films. This research provides a throughout study on III-nitrides, such as AlN, GaN and AlGaN thin films, which were grown at low temperatures (400\u2013600 \u00b0C). Growth rate, stoichiometry and crystal structure of low temperature growth films will be reported by using several advanced post-growth analysis techniques. Temperature, pressure, and V/III molar ratio were also investigated to determine their effect on the film properties. From the study, a better understanding of the relationships between film properties and growth parameters will be achieved.", "This paper presents effect of low temperature annealing on the physical properties of ZnO thin films for photovoltaic applications. The thin films of thickness 50nm were grown on glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates employing radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique followed by thermal annealing within low temperature range 150\u2013450\u00b0C. These as-grown and annealed films were subjected to the X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer, source meter and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for structural, optical, electrical and surface morphological analysis respectively. The compositional analysis of the as-grown ZnO film was also carried out using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The XRD patterns reveal that the films have wurtzite structure of hexagonal phase with preferred orientation (100) and polycrystalline in nature. The crystallographic and optical parameters are calculated and discussed in detail. The optical band gap was found in the range 3.30\u20133.52eV and observed to decrease with annealing temperature except 150\u00b0C. The current\u2013voltage characteristics show that the films exhibit approximately ohmic behavior. The SEM studies show that the films are uniform, homogeneous and free from crystal defects and voids. The experimental results reveal that ZnO thin films may be used as alternative materials for eco-friendly buffer layer to the thin film solar cell applications.", "We report on optical field enhanced nonlinear absorption and on the optical limiting properties of a 1-D photonic crystal with ZnO defect, fabricated by rf sputtering technique. The structural properties of the photonic crystal are studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Light transmission spectroscopy measurement shows a broad photonic band gap with a defect mode. Open aperture Z-scan measurement with 532nm pulsed laser illustrates a four times enhancement in the nonlinear absorption coefficient, due to local field enhanced two-photon absorption in the photonic crystal structure with respect to the single layer of ZnO reference. The enhancement of the nonlinear absorption in the photonic crystal, due to the strong confinement of the optical field around ZnO defect layer, leads to an optical power limiting behavior in the photonic crystal. The limiting threshold of the photonic crystal is found to be 0.74J/cm2 @ 532nm with 6ns pulse width, 10Hz repetition rate.", "The thermoelectric generator has been an attractive alternative power source to operate a wireless sensor node. Usually, inorganic compounds are most often used in thermoelectric devices, and hence, are extensively studied due to their superior thermoelectric performance. We have investigated a novel interfacial technique to fabricate a hybrid film of highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) and graphene. Organic materials PEDOT doped with PSS exhibits outstanding electrical properties due to its high conductivity, low bandgap, and energy migration. Furthermore, we utilized graphene fabricated by rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) as a thermoelectric material. Our results show that the interfacial technique between substrate and hybrid film could be clearly improved due to the UV plasma treatment. The thermoelectric hybrid film of PEDOT:PSS and RTCVD graphene (P/RTG) exhibited an enhanced power factor of 56.28 \u03bcW m\u22121 K\u22122 with a Seebeck coefficient of 54.0 \u03bcV K\u22121.", "Cadmium sulphide finds extensive applications in a variety of optoelectronic devices. CdS, with a band gap of 2.43eV, is a suitable window material in heterojunction solar cells that employ CdTe, Cu2S or CuInSe2 as an absorber. Polycrystalline films of CdS, thickness \u223c15\u03bcm, were grown onto chemically clean and optically plane glass substrates by sintering process. A 10min sintering time and 500\u00b0C sintering temperature were found to be optimum. As deposited films were characterized through optical, structural and electrical transport properties using optical reflection spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry and I\u2013V characteristics techniques.", "We report the effects of iodine doping on the optical and structural properties of amorphous carbon thin-films grown on silicon and quartz substrates by microwave surface wave plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at low temperature (100\u00b0C). For film deposition, we used Ar and CH4 as plasma source gases. The films were characterized by UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy measurements. The optical band gap of the films decreased from 3 to 0.8eV corresponding to non-doping to iodine doping conditions. The XPS results confirm the successful doping of iodine in the films. The Raman results show that iodine doping induced more graphitization in the films.", "Wurtzite p-type GaN epilayer, which has a thickness of 0.5\u03bcm, is prepared by MOCVD on GaN buffer with sapphire substrate. Magnetic doping of the p-type GaN epilayer is achieved by 180keV Mn+ ions implantation. The GaN films are all implanted with dose of 5\u00d71015cm\u22122, while are kept at different temperatures during the implantation, i.e. room temperature, 300 and 500\u00b0C, respectively. After an annealing step at 850\u00b0C for 30s in flowing N2, the magnetism of the Mn+-implanted p-GaN films is investigated by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). In the sample implanted at room temperature the magnetism is weak and no ferromagnetism is found. In the 300\u00b0C implanted p-GaN film ferromagnetism is found with obvious hysteresis loop. Further increase in the implantation temperature to 500\u00b0C brings about no increase in ferromagnetism. Combined with the structural characteristics of the Mn+-implanted p-GaN films studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), one concludes that only suitable increase of the implantation temperature could be beneficial to the recovery of implantation defects and the generation of ferromagnetism in the Mn+-implanted p-GaN films.", "The spinel system MnGaxFe1\u2212xCrO4 (x=0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0) was prepared by the solid state sintering method in air at 1523K. X-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements were performed on the samples at 295K for structural characterization. Rietveld refinement of the neutron diffraction data revealed that all the samples of the series possessed cubic symmetry corresponding to the space group Fd3m. The distributions of the four cations Mn, Ga, Fe and Cr over the two sublattices and other crystallographic parameters were found. The lattice constant showed a decrease with increasing Ga content in the system. The magnetic structure at room temperature was found to be ferrimagnetic in the composition range x\u2a7d0.50.", "U/Fe and U/Gd multilayers constitute magnetic systems, which can be used to probe the hybridisation of the 5f electrons of uranium with 3d and 4f electrons, respectively. A range of samples with varying layer thicknesses was prepared by DC sputtering in a UHV chamber. X-ray and neutron reflectivity and X-ray diffraction were used to characterise the structure of the U/Fe [A.M. Beesley, M.F. Thomas, A.D.F. Herring, R.C.C. Ward, M.R. Wells, S. Langridge, S.D. Brown, S.W. Zochowski, L. Bouchenoire, W.G. Stirling, G.H. Lander, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 16 (2004) 8491] and U/Gd systems. A combination of polarised neutron reflectivity, SQUID magnetometry and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism have revealed an induced moment on the U site in U/Fe structures and a saturation magnetisation which increases with increasing Fe and Gd thickness.", "Magnetoelectric composites, namely, xNiFe2O4+(1\u2212x)Ba0.9Sr0.1TiO3 were prepared by standard double sintering ceramic method. The X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out to check the phases formed during sintering and to calculate the lattice parameters. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs were taken to understand the microstructure of the samples. The dielectric constant (\u03b5\u2032) and loss tangent (tan\u03b4) were measured as a function of frequency in the frequency range 100Hz\u20131MHz. Variation of dielectric constant and loss tangent with temperature and composition has been reported. The hysteresis measurements were done to determine saturation magnetization (MS) and coersivity (Hc). The variation of saturation magnetization and magnetic moment is interpreted in terms of composition.", "The structural and magnetic properties of sputtered Fe/Cu multilayers are examined as a function of Fe layer thickness t Fe by means of X-ray diffraction, M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometry and superconducting quantum interference magnetometer. The temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization M(T) is well described by a T 3/2 law in all multilayers in the temperature range 5\u2013300K. The interface anisotropy constant of Fe/Cu multilayers, K s, is found to be 0.31 and 0.45erg/cm2 at 5 and 300K, respectively. A spin-wave theory has been used to explain the temperature dependence of the magnetization and the approximate values for the bulk exchange interaction J b, surface exchange interaction J s and the interlayer coupling strength J I for various Fe layer thicknesses have been obtained.", "Rod-like and platelet-like nanoparticles of simple-crystalline barium hexaferrite (BaFe12O19) have been synthesized by the molten salt method. Both particle size and morphology change with the reaction temperature and time. The easy magnetization direction (00l) of the BaFe12O19 nanoparticles has been observed directly by performing X-ray diffraction on powders aligned at 0.5T magnetic field. The magnetic properties of the BaFe12O19 magnet were investigated with various sintering temperatures. The maximum values of saturation magnetization (\u03c3s=65.8emu/g), remanent magnetization (\u03c3r=56emu/g) and coercivity field (Hic=5251Oe) of the aligned samples occurred at the sintering temperatures of 1100\u00b0C. These results indicate that BaFe12O19 nanoparticles synthesized by the molten salt method should enable detailed investigation of the size-dependent evolution of magnetism, microwave absorption, and realization of a nanodevice of magnetic media.", "Magnetization and magnetoresistance studies were carried out on the granular FexCuyAgz films prepared by dc magnetron sputtering. In this series of samples, we have substituted Ag in the parent Fe\u2013Cu system such that the Ag concentration increases from zero while that of the Cu decreases to zero when we go from one sample to another. The blocking temperatures of the films lie in the range 20\u201350K. By using a model, the room temperature magnetization data have been analyzed by determining the contributions from the smaller superparamagnetic particles and larger ferromagnetic particles. Size distributions of the superparamagnetic particles are obtained. The magnetoresistance and (M/Ms)2 data do not agree for most of the samples investigated. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the (M/Ms)2 behavior is valid for purely superparamagnetic particles of only one size whereas there are both superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic particles in our samples. When we analyzed the magnetoresistance data using a superparamagnetic model, a good agreement between the experimental data and the simulated data were obtained for some samples. Significant discrepancy observed for other samples may be due to the spin dependent scattering of the electrons traveling from superparamagnetic to ferromagnetic particles or vice versa.", "We prepared Zn0.98Co0.02O nanopowders by conventional sol\u2013gel method. The powders were sintered at different temperatures. The X-ray diffraction patters showed only wurtzite structure without any impurity phase, better crystalline structure and larger grain size with higher sintering temperature. The magnetic measurements showed that all the powders exhibited paramagnetism with weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. The quenched magnetic moment of Co ions was attributed to the weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between single Co ions and the antiparallel spin alignment of neighboring aggregated Co ions.", "ZnO thin films were deposited on corning glass substrates by RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The dependence of crystal structure, morphology and optical properties on post-deposition annealing was investigated using XRD, AFM and UV\u2013vis Spectrophotometer. The as-deposited films were amorphous in nature. Post-deposition annealing for 1h in air caused an improvement in crystallinity with preferential orientation along (002) direction. Better crystallinity was observed at 673K. Crystallite size increased from 16 to 27nm as annealing temperature was increased from 473 to 873K. It is evident from AFM analysis that rms roughness of the film annealed at 673K is minimum indicating better optical quality. Optical measurements show a decrease in direct band gap from 3.289 (as deposited) to 3.25eV when the annealing temperature was increased to 673K. With further increase in temperature, band gap increases.", "This paper aims to report that impurity phase free single phase multiferroic BiFeO3 ceramic can be prepared by critically optimizing the metal ion concentration using slow step sintering schedule at 850\u00b0C for 24h. Antiferromagnetic character of pure BiFeO3 is completely changed and ferromagnetic behavior observed with increase of Bi as well as decrease of Fe concentration. It is found that Bi rich (Bi: 1.2) Fe deficient (Fe: 0.8) composition produces single phase rhombohedral structure with space group R3c along with enhanced ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties. Incorporation of excess bismuth caused structural distortion and expected to compensate Bi loss during high temperature sintering. On the other hand, iron deficient helps the formation of Fe3+ state, which hinders the creation of oxygen vacancies and also favors the reduction of leakage current. Structural distortion in BiFeO3 changes Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe bond angle or spin order, destructs the spin cycloid and releases a locked magnetization.", "Solid solutions of bismuth layered (Bi2O3)(BaxMo1\u2212xO3) (0.2\u2264x\u22640.8, x is in step of 0.2) ceramics were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction of the constitutive oxides at optimized temperatures with a view to study its electrical properties. Powder X-ray diffraction has been employed for physical characterization and an average grain size of \u223c16 to 22nm was obtained. XRD study reveals the single phase structure of the samples. Dielectric properties such as dielectric constant (\u03b5\u2032), dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) and ac electrical conductivity (\u03c3ac) of the prepared ceramics sintered at various temperatures in the frequency range 101\u2013107Hz have been studied. A strong dispersion observed in the dielectric properties shows the relaxor type behavior of the ceramic. The presence of maxima in the dielectric permittivity spectra indicates the ferroelectric behavior of the samples. Impedance plots (Cole\u2013Cole plots) at different frequencies and temperatures were used to analyze the electric behavior. The value of grain resistance increases with the increase in Ba ion concentration. The conductivity mechanism shows a frequency dependence, which can be ascribed to the space charge mainly due to the oxygen vacancies. The relaxation observed for the M\u2033 (\u03c9) or Z\u2033 (\u03c9) curves is correlated to both localized and long range conduction. A single \u2018master curve\u2019 for the normalized plots of all the modulus isotherms observed for a given composition indicates that the conductivity relaxation is temperature independent.", "The influence of sputtering parameters and annealing on the structure and optical properties of TiO2 thin films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering is reported. A pure TiO2 target was used to deposit the films on Si(100) and glass substrates, and Ar/O2 gas mixture was used for sputtering. It was found that both the structure and the optical properties of the films depend on deposition parameters and annealing. In all cases the as-deposited films were oxygen deficient, which could be compensated by post-deposition annealing. Changes in the Ar/O2 mass flow rate affected the films from an amorphous-like structure for samples deposited without oxygen to a structure where nano-crystalline rutile phase is detected in those deposited with O2. Annealing of the samples yielded growth of both, rutile and anatase phases, the ratio depending on the added oxygen content. Increasing mass flow rate of O2 and annealing are responsible for lowering of the energy band gap values and the increase in refractive index of the films. The results can be interesting towards the development of TiO2 thin films with defined structure and properties.", "The magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of Er\u2013Co thin films fabricated by sputtering under an Ar pressure (PAr) varying from 2 to 10mTorr in steps of 2mTorr are investigated. The content of Co in the sputtered thin films decreases slightly as the PAr increases from 2 to 10mTorr, resulting in a film composition varying from ErCo1.07 to ErCo0.93. Extensive changes in the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties are observed. As the PAr increases, the compensation temperature increases substantially from 83 to 141K, as well as the temperature at which the maximum change in the magnetic entropy occurs, particularly in the low PAr range. Considering the small change observed in the composition of the thin films as a function of PAr, the changes in the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties are extensive, indicating that the PAr plays an important role in affecting the aforementioned properties in amorphous magnetic thin films.", "Structure and optical of polycrystalline NiO films fabricated by reactive sputtering and its resistive switching properties in Au/NiO/Pt structures are investigated. The size of surface uniform pyramid-like islands and average surface roughness increase with the increase of NiO film thickness (t). The NiO films grow with the preferred (111) orientation at 400\u00b0C, but both (100) and (110)-oriented grains exist in the films fabricated at room temperature. Raman results reveal that the crystallinity of the films fabricated at 400\u00b0C becomes good by comparing with that at room temperature. The optical band gap monotonically decreases from 4.44eV at t=22nm to 3.55eV at t=800nm. The resistance of the Au/NiO/Pt/Ti/glass structures could be switched between two stable states including low and high resistance states. The bipolar endurance performance of the resistive switching remains nondegradable after 200 cycles. The resistive switching can be ascribed to the carrier trapping and detrapping induced by the electric field, which can change the thickness of the depletion layer at Au/NiO interface.", "Zinc oxide receives remarkable attention due to its several attractive physical properties. Zinc oxide thin films doped with nitrogen were grown by employing RF magnetron sputtering method at room temperature. Doping was accomplished in gaseous medium by mixing high purity nitrogen gas along with argon sputtering gas. Structural studies confirmed the high crystalline nature with c-axis oriented growth of the nitrogen doped zinc oxide thin films. The tensile strain was developed due to the incorporation of the nitrogen into the ZnO crystal lattice. Surface roughness of the grown films was found to be decreased with increasing doping level was identified through atomic force microscope analysis. The presenting phonon modes of each film were confirmed through FTIR spectral analysis. The increasing doping level leads towards red-shifting of the cut-off wavelength due to decrement of the band gap was identified through UV\u2013vis spectroscopy. All the doped films exhibited p-type conductivity was ascertained using Hall measurements and the obtained results were presented.", "Iron nitride thin films of different compositions and thicknesses were deposited on flexible polymer substrate in Ar/N2 atmosphere by reactive magnetron sputtering under varying nitrogen flow rates. The nano structured films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer, electrochemical impedance (EIS), atomic force (AFM) and transmission electron microscopies. The dependence of their functional properties on coating and growth conditions was studied in detail. It was found that the thin films show a uniform permeability in the frequency range of 200MHz to 1Ghz and can be used in this range without appreciable changes. Decrease of nitrogen flow rate resulted in the smoother surfaces which in turn increase transmittance quality and corrosion resistance. Functional properties are dependent of nature, relative concentration of the iron nitride phases and film thickness. Surface integrity is excellent for180 nm thick sample because the films appear to be very dense and free from open pores. By keeping sputtering power stable at 110W, nitrogen flow rate of 10 sccm was ideal to develop the ferromagnetic \u03b3\u02b9Fe4N phase at room temperature.", "Hexagonal nanocrystallites of ZnO in the form of thin films were prepared by radio frequency sputtering technique. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals two prominent diffraction planes (002) and (103) at diffraction angles around 34.3 and 62.8\u00b0, respectively. The crystallite size increases through (103) plane from 56.1 to 64.8\u202f\u00c5 as film thickness changed from 31\u202fnm up to 280\u202fnm while crystallites growth through (002) increased from 124 to 136\u202f\u00c5 as film thickness varies from 31 to 107\u202fnm and dropped to 115.8\u202f\u00c5\u202fat thickness 280\u202fnm. The particle shape changes from spherical to longitudinal form. The particle size is 25\u202fnm for films of thickness below 107\u202fnm and increases at higher thicknesses (134 and 280\u202fnm) from 30 to 40\u202fnm, respectively. Optical band gap is deduced to be direct with values varied from 3.22 to 3.28\u202feV and the refractive index are evaluated based on the optical band values according to Moss, Ravindra-Srivastava, and Dimitrov-Sakka models. All refractive index models gave values around 2.3.", "In this paper we propose a new experimental method to investigate the principle of \u2018Mixed-\u03bc\u2019 levitation systems. To confirm our claim, we measured the attractive force and the variation of flux passing through both, the HTS sample and the face surface of iron yoke, when the yoke is approached/retreated to the surface of field-cooled HTS sample. It is revealed that when the diameter of the yoke is less than the diameter of the HTS, in the small gap by reducing the gap, the flux which passes through the face surface of the yoke and consequently the attractive force will decrease. Therefore, stable levitation is achievable. However, when the diameter of yoke is equal to the diameter of the HTS, the magnetic flux will not decrease for a reducing gap and stable levitation is unfeasible. Briefly, stable levitation is achievable when the yoke diameter is less than the HTS\u2019s diameter. Additionally, as the yoke is approached to the HTS the flux variation of the HTS in 77K is negligible compare to the flux variation of the HTS in the room temperature. Therefore, in superconductivity state the pinned fluxes in the HTS samples remain approximately constant and the HTS acts as a \u2018magnetic isolator\u2019. This specification can be used to simulate the behavior of field-cooled HTS by the FEM software.", "Effects of Ag2O doping on the electromagnetic properties in the BiSrCaCuO oxides was investigated. The electromagnetic properties of Ag2O doped and undoped BiSrCaCuO superconductor were evaluated to investigate the contribution of the pinning centers to the magnetic effect. It was confirmed experimentally that a large amount of magnetic flux was trapped in the Ag2O doped sample than that in the undoped one, indicating that the pinning centers of magnetic flux are related closely to the occurrence of the magnetic effect. During the sintering, doped Ag2O was converted to Ag particles which were finely dispersed in superconductor samples. It is considered that the area where normal conduction takes place increases by adding Ag2O and the magnetic flux penetrating through the sample increases. The results suggested that Ag2O acts to increase pinning centers of magnetic flux, contributing to the occurrence of the electromagnetic properties.", "The effects of Zn substitution on the uniform (q=0) magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7(T), of optimally doped (x=0.15) La2\u2212xSrxCu1\u2212yZnyO4 sintered samples were investigated over a wide range of Zn contents (y). Non-magnetic Zn was found to enhance \u03c7(T) systematically and depress Tc very effectively. We have extracted the characteristic pseudogap energy scale, \u03b5g, from the analysis of \u03c7(T) data. Unlike Tc, \u03b5g was found to be fairly insensitive to the level of Zn substitution. This supports the scenario where the pseudogap phenomenon has non-superconducting origin. We have also analyzed the Zn-induced Curie-like enhancement of the \u03c7(T) data using different models and discussed the various possible implications.", "Mo x (MgB2)1\u2212 x bulk system was prepared by three steps rapid sintering method. From the X-ray powder diffraction experiments, Mo was confirmed as the isolated impurity in MgB2-phase. In the present system, the superconducting transition temperature T c was about 39K without apparent reduction in 0.01 \u2a7d x \u2a7d 0.06. The critical current density J c was estimated from the fitting of theoretical expression of magnetization curve by extended critical state model to the experimental data. The J c at 20K and 1 T showed a maximal value at x =0.01.", "Compared with the permanent magnet, the magnetized bulk high-Tc superconductor magnet (MBSCM) can trap higher magnetic field due to its strong flux pinning ability, so it is a good candidate to improve the levitation performance of high-Tc superconductive (HTS) maglev system. The trapped magnetic flux of a MBSCM is sustained by the inductive superconducting current produced by the magnetizing process and is susceptible to the current intensity as well as configuration. In the HTS maglev system, the lateral displacement is an important process to change the superconducting current within a MBSCM and then affects its levitation performance, which is essential for the traffic ability in curve-way, the loading capacity of lateral impact and so on. The research about influence of lateral displacement on the levitation performance of MBSCM is necessary when MBSCM is applied on the HTS maglev vehicle. The experimental investigations about the influence of lateral displacement on the levitation performance of a MBSCM with different trapped fluxes and applied fields are processed in this article. The analyses and conclusions of this article are useful for the practical application of MBSCM in HTS maglev system.", "The present study focuses on the effects of standby time of the MgB2 samples immersed in synthetic engine oil on the critical current density ( Jc(H)), magnetic field dependence of the pinning force density fp(b) and Tc performances of MgB2 bulk superconductors. Synthetic engine oil was used as a product which is cheap and a rich carbon source. Manufactured MgB2 pellet samples were immersed at different standby time of 30min, 120min, 300min and 1440min in synthetic engine oil after the first heating process. Finally, MgB2 samples immersed in synthetic engine oil were sintered at 1000\u00b0C and kept for 15min in Ar atmosphere. The critical current density of all of MgB2 samples immersed at different standby time in engine oil in whole field range was better than that of the pure MgB2 sample because of the number of the pinning centers. The MgB2 sample immersed at 300min standby time in synthetic engine oil has the best performance compared to other samples. The Jc value for the pure sample is 2.0\u00d7103A/cm2, whereas for the MgB2 sample immersed at 300min standby time in engine oil the Jc is enhanced to 4.8\u00d7103A/cm2 at 5K and 3T. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) did not change with the increasing standby time of the samples in synthetic engine oil at all. The best diamagnetic property was obtained from the sample which kept in synthetic engine oil for 300min. Synthetic engine oil treatment results in remarkable improvement of the critical current density and pinning force performances of MgB2 superconductors. It was found that all MgB2 samples have a different pinning property at different measuring temperatures. Using synthetic engine oil as a product which is cheap and a rich carbon source in MgB2 bulk superconductors makes MgB2 samples immersed in synthetic engine oil a good candidate for industrial applications.", "Cadmium selenide thin films were prepared by chemical bath deposition (CBD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) methods. For CBD films, cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and cadmium acetate (Cd(CH3COO)2) solutions were employed as Cd2+ source while a freshly prepared sodium selenosulfite (Na2SeSO3) solution provided the Se2\u2212 ions. The pH of the bath was adjusted by adding ammonium hydroxide. The effects of the bath temperatures (30\u201390\u00b0C) and the Cd/Se ratio on film properties were investigated. On the other hand, PLD films were grown by the ablation of a sintered pure CdSe target using a Nd:YAG laser beam (355nm) with 1J/cm2 fluence. The deposition chamber was maintained under vacuum pressure (10\u22126mbar) and at room temperature. The CBD films are constituted by crystallites of metastable cubic phase (7nm) with some amorphous phase present, whereas the PLD films showed better crystalline quality and higher crystalline size. Optical absorption analysis shows that the band gap value of the CBD films is higher than that of the bulk material and decreases with the bath temperature. Annealing transforms the metastable cubic phase into the hexagonal phase and causes a \u201credshift\u201d in the band gap of the CBD and PLD films due to the crystal size increase.", "Er-doped ZnO films were deposited by direct current co-reactive magnetron sputtering technique and the microstructure and the optical properties of the ZnO films were investigated. XRD analysis reveals that the substrate temperatures have an evident effect on the (002) preferential orientation and the Er-doped ZnO film deposited at room temperature consists of an amorphous phase. The blue shift of the optical band gap was observed in the ZnO:Er films compared with undoped ZnO film, and the Er-doped ZnO film deposited at room temperature has the largest band gap (about 3.99eV). The main reason for the broadening of the band gap is attributed to the amorphous phase in the Er-doped ZnO film. Meanwhile, the red shift of the band gap in the ZnO:Er films deposited at high temperature was observed as the crystallinity of the fim became better.", "The growth and optical properties of Ag/dielectric and Au/dielectric bilayer thin films are reported. The metal layer is deposited on top of the dielectric layer, which is either TiO2 or ZrO2. The dielectric films were prepared by the sol\u2013gel method whereas the metal films (5\u201350nm thick) were deposited on the dielectrics by ion beam sputter deposition. The surface morphology of the metal layer is strongly dependent on the dielectric layer over which it is deposited. The bilayer thin films show enhanced light absorption in the ultraviolet region and refractive index controlled optical absorption at near infrared wavelengths. In addition, they display the tunability in surface plasmon resonances exhibited normally by core\u2013shell and bimetal nanostructures. In the presence of the metal layer, the absorption coefficient of the bilayer is enhanced, by almost 7 times, in the region of the band gap. The surface plasmon resonance of the metal exhibits a red-shift with increase in refractive index of the dielectric underlayer. The plasmon resonance for Ag is observed at a wavelength of 424nm on ZrO2, which shifts to 434nm on TiO2. Similarly in the case of Au films, the shift is from 630nm on ZrO2 to 640nm on TiO2. Interestingly, the optical absorption in the near IR region increases with increase in refractive index of the dielectric underlayer.", "Indium nitride (InN) films with different free electron concentration and optical bandgap were grown either directly on sapphire substrate or on pre-covered gallium nitride (GaN) buffer through metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method. Based on first-principle calculations, we confirm that the widening of InN optical bandgap reported before is caused by high density of free electrons. To find the contributor of the free electrons, the characteristic energetic levels of ON, VN and SiIn are investigated. We find that they are all high enough to uplift the optical bandgap from about 0.78 eV to 1.9 eV, which almost can't be enlarged further when it reaches 2.09 eV.", "Flat, B-doped, low-stress and non-stress polysilicon (poly-Si) thin films were deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). X-ray diffraction (XRD), combined with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman system, UV-Raman measurements and spectroscopic ellipsometry, was used to study the microstructure, the morphology and optical properties of the films. The results indicate that the surface roughness is related to the grain size and the change in the microstructure. The B-doped poly-Si shows a tensile stress, while the flat poly-Si shows a high compressive stress. The bandgap of the B-doped poly-Si is the narrowest because of its most disordered microstructure.", "Dielectric response of thin-film capacitor structures of Pt/PZT/Pt deposited by the RF magnetron sputtering method and annealed at temperatures of 540\u2013570\u2009\u00b0C was investigated. It was found that dielectric properties of these structures depend on the synthesis temperature. Stability of a polarized state is considered on the basis of the analysis of hysteresis loops and capacitance\u2013voltage (C\u2013V) characteristics. The contribution of the domain mechanism in the dielectric response of the capacitor structure comprising a ferroelectric is discussed. Extreme dependences of electrophysical characteristics of PZT films on their synthesis temperature were observed. Correlation of dielectric properties with microstructure of these films is found out.", "Electromagnetic signals in deep reservoir are very weak so that it is difficult to predict about the presence of hydrocarbon in seabed logging (SBL) environment. In the present work, Mn0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 nanoferrites were prepared by a sol\u2013gel technique at different sintering temperatures of 450\u00b0C, 650\u00b0C and 850\u00b0C to increase the strength of electromagnetic (EM) antenna. XRD, FESEM, Raman spectroscopy and HRTEM were used to analyze the phase, surface morphology and size of the nanoferrites. Magnetic properties of the nanoferrites were also measured using an impedance network analyzer. However, nanoferrites sintered at 850\u00b0C with initial permeability of 200 and Q factor of 50 were used as magnetic feeders with the EM antenna. Lab scale experiments were performed to investigate the effect of magnetic field strength in scale tank. SPSS and MATLAB softwares were also used to confirm the oil presence in scale tank. It was observed that the magnitude of the EM waves for the antenna was increased up to 233%. Finally, the correlation values also show 208% increase in the magnetic field strength with the presence of the oil. Therefore, antenna with Mn0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 nanoferrites based magnetic feeders can be used for deep water and deep target hydrocarbon exploration.", "Magnetic and conducting polypropylene (PP) polymer nanocomposites with different loadings of synthetic carbon nanotubes (CNT-Fe) were fabricated by in-situ polymerization. Chemical vapor deposition was used as the synthetic route for carbon nanotube (CNT) synthesis, in which high-surface-area silica (SiO2) acts as the support and ferrocene as the precursor and catalyst. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy analyses evidence the homogenous dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix. It was found that, with the addition of 3.8 wt.% of the filler, the insulating PP matrix changes to a semiconductor. The magnetic properties of the nanocomposites were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer. The addition of 0.8 wt.% CNTs results in ferromagnetic behavior in the diamagnetic polymer matrix and high coercivities at room temperature. The thermal properties were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Results show an increase in the maximum degradation, crystallization, and melting temperatures of the nanocomposites as compared with neat PP.", "Electrochemical synthesis of very adherent polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANi) films were achieved on 1\u03bcm thick nickel (Ni) coated mild steel (MS) samples. Electrodeposition of Ni layer on MS was carried out galvanostatically, in an appropriate bath solution and cyclic voltammetry technique was used for synthesis of the polymer top coats, in monomer containing oxalic acid solutions. The corrosion performances of nickel coated samples with and without polymer top coats were investigated in 3.5% NaCl solution, by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and anodic polarization curves. It was found that electrodeposited 1\u03bcm thick Ni layer had quite porous structure, therefore, it could exhibit restricted barrier property and its protection efficiency diminished with time. It was shown that the presence of a polymer top coat could improve the barrier property significantly and lead to much better protection against the corrosion of underlying MS. PPy film was found to be more effective as top coat on Ni coated MS, with respect to PANi film.", "Finemet bulk soft magnetic alloy was fabricated by spark plasma sintering of the milled ribbons. The amorphous melt-spun ribbons were milled for 36min by high energy vibrational mill and then sieved to separate particles smaller than 125\u03bcm. The size distribution of particles was determined by a laser diffraction particle size analyzer. Spark plasma sintering was carried out at super-cooled liquid region for short times of 7 and 21min. The structure of bulk samples was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The magnetization and coercivity of samples were measured using SQUID magnetometry. The results indicated that during sintering the Fe(Si) phase with grain size of 9nm forms in the amorphous matrix. The amount of Fe(Si) phase was calculated as 84wt.% in the sample consolidated from fully amorphous powder for 7min. The magnetization and coercivity of this sample was measured as 122.29emug\u22121 and 123Am\u22121, respectively. The relative density of consolidated samples for 7 and 21min was reached to 96 and ~97% of theoretical density, respectively. Recording the punch displacement with respect to the time showed that the particles rearrangement and viscous flow with activation energy of 23.4kJmol\u22121 were the main mechanisms of densification at the first and second stages of densification, respectively.", "Considering the performance of parent Fe(III)-Cu(II) binary oxide nanoparticles in removing numerous contaminants from water, in order to prevent the release of the nanostructures into the cleaned water a deposit with the same composition was introduced into the matrix of a synthetic porous material (ion exchange resin), whereby a hybrid ion exchanger (HIX) was obtained. Amberlite 900 Cl, a commercially available strongly basic macroreticular anion exchanger, was used as the supporting material. The inorganic deposit was introduced into its structure in two steps performed batchwise at ambient temperature. Fe(III)-Cu(II) binary oxide could be deposited into the matrix of the strongly basic anion exchanger owing to the affinity of its functional groups for FeCl4 \u2212 and CuCl4 2\u2212 ions. When in the ion exchange reaction the anion exchanger bound both the ions and the reaction medium alkalized, the respective oxides FeOOH and CuO precipitated in its structure. The oxide deposit was introduced into the ion exchanger in three ways, whereby HIXs differing in their oxide content, in the mole ratio of the oxides and in the latter's atypical distribution in the matrix of the anion exchanger were obtained. Regardless of the method of conducting the reaction, HIXs rich in oxides, e.g. 3.73\u202fmmol (Fe, Cu) g\u22121 (2.35\u202fmmol Fe and 1.38\u202fmmol Cu g\u22121 at Fe/Cu\u202f=\u202f1.7) were obtained. The products were investigated by SEM, EDXS, T/TG/DTA, XRD and VSM. The doped HIXs are characterized by a core-shell structure, where the core consists of polymeric beads and the outer thin layer contains Fe and Cu in their oxidized form. The structure of the outer layer varies depending on the procedure of precipitation. These differences are also reflected in the magnetic properties (ferromagnetic or paramagnetic interaction). CuFe2O4 was found to be present in the samples sintered at 900 and 1300\u00b0C, which proves that a ferrite can form from the deposit after a solid-state reaction at high temperatures.", "A thermoelectric material with sufficient performance at high temperatures is a key factor for thermoelectric generation from solar-thermal energy (I. R. radiation). In this study, we analyzed CoSb3 skutterudite compounds as a thermoelectric material at high temperatures and synthesized filled skutterudites with two types of filler atoms: 1) Yb- and La-fillers with a different electronegativity (X) from the Sb atoms and 2) the In-filler with nearly the same electronegativity (X) as the Sb atoms. All the samples were sintered with the spark plasma sintering method, and their thermoelectric properties were investigated. From the results, the Yb atoms were the most effective in decreasing the thermal conductivity of this system due to their very different electronegativity (X) value from the Sb atoms and lower melting temperature than that of the La-filler. In addition, In-filled compositions had high power factor values while the In-free composition had the lowest power factor value due to its lower melting temperature. The addition of La atoms for filling was not effective in reducing the thermal conductivity of this filled skutterudite system due to its higher melting point. A maximum ZT value of 0.9 at 782\u00a0K was obtained in the In0.1Yb0.2Co4Sb12 specimen.", "Buffer layers such as CdS and ZnS are used in high efficiency Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells. Eliminating buffer layer is attractive to realize low-cost thin film solar cells by reducing fabrication process. However, the elimination of the buffer layers leads to shunting due to the interface recombination between transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and CIGS layers. To reduce the interface recombination, the control of conduction band offset (CBO) is effective. In this study, we fabricated Zn1\u2212x Mgx O:Al (ZMO:Al) as the TCO for the CBO control. ZMO:Al was prepared by co-sputtering of ZnO:Al2O3 (ZnO:Al) and MgO:Al2O3 targets. ZMO:Al shows high transmittance in visible region and the band gap energy widen with the addition of Mg to ZnO:Al. Buffer-less CIGS solar cells with an Al/NiCr/TCO/CIGS/Mo/soda-lime glass structure using ZMO:Al and ZnO:Al were fabricated. For comparison, ZnO/CdS buffered cell was also fabricated. Current density-voltage characteristics of the devices showed the cell with ZMO:Al film achieved higher efficiency compared to the buffer-less cell with ZnO:Al. This result suggested that the control of CBO is important to reduce interface recombination between TCO layer and CIGS absorber.", "The synthesis and characterization of thin M-type barium hexaferrite (BaFe12O19 or BaM) films on silicon are reported. Multilayer in situ technique was employed to anneal the films at 850\u2013900\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin. The thickness dependence of the magnetic properties of the BaM films has been investigated using VSM. For the BaM 150\u202fnm thickness film, acicular BaM grains were present having their c-axis randomly oriented. For the BaM films thicker than 150\u202fnm, lattice relaxation favors the c-axis to be aligned in the film plane. The micromagnetic simulation was used to model the out-of-plane and the in-plane hysteresis loops. We have achieved good matching between the experimental data and the model. Using the micromagnetic model, we have estimated the deflection angle of c-axis from the normal plane \u03b8\u202f=\u202f25\u00b0 for the 150\u202fnm thick film.", "Lead-free multiferroic particulate composites of Ni0.83Co0.15Cu0.02Fe1.9O4-\u03b4\u2013Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NCCF\u2013NBT) ceramics are synthesized by spark plasma sintering in conjunction with high-energy ball milling. The exhibition of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric characteristics demonstrates that these materials are multiferroic in nature. Magnetic measurements indicate that the composites exhibit an excellent combination of saturation magnetization and coercivity at room temperature. In addition, they have a large magnetoelectric voltage sensitivity, which is up to 663mVcm\u22121Oe\u22121 under a magnetic field of 5kOe for the 0.5NCCF\u20130.5NBT composite.", "We comparatively studied the critical current density, magnetization and specific heat of the rolled and the hot-pressed Sr1\u2212xKxFe2As2 tapes. The Schottky anomaly that is obvious in the specific heat of the rolled tape disappears in the hot-pressed tape. Moreover, the hot-pressed tape has a higher fraction of superconductivity and a narrower distribution of superconducting transition temperature than the rolled tape. Combined with the magnetization data, we conclude that sintering under high pressure provides a better environment for complete chemical reaction and more homogenous dopant distribution, which is beneficial to the global current of a superconductor.", "Microwave sintering of metal powder compacts is simulated within a simple semi-analytical multiphysics model taking into account the effective dielectric and magnetic properties. It is demonstrated that microwave heating exhibits resonant behavior which facilitates rapid densification of powder metals in a way similar to flash sintering. Rapid, stable and efficient microwave sintering regimes can be implemented by using adaptive control over the intensity and/or frequency of the microwave radiation.", "Carbon and nitrogen were co-doped into TiO2 nanotube arrays (C\u2013N-TNTAs) to extend their light response region using the chemical bath deposition method. The as-synthesized C\u2013N-TNTAs were employed as the working anode in photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments. Using the applied bias potential, the recombination of photo-generated holes and electrons was reduced significantly. The crystalline, optical properties, surface morphology, and structure of the C\u2013N-TNTAs were characterized by XRD, UV\u2013vis absorbance edges, SEM, and XPS, respectively. The XRD results showed the C\u2013N-TNTAs were dominated by the anatase phase after sintering at 450\u00b0C with significant visible light response. XPS analyses indicated nitrogen doping was mainly responsible for reducing the band gap as evidence of 0.82% N doping into the structure via the linkage of the TiON and NTiO bond. SEM images illustrated the diameter of the supported TiO2 nanotubes was approximately 90\u2013100nm with a length of approximately 400nm. After carbon and nitrogen co-doping, the nanotubular structure of TiO2 nanotube kept its integrity with no significant morphological change, which was beneficial for PEC applications. The degradation efficiency of methyl orange (MO) was examined by photoelectrochemical, photocatalytic, electrochemical and photolysis methods for comparison in terms of pseudo-first-order reaction rate. The PEC method had the best MO degradation efficiency with a rate constant of 2.3\u00d710\u22123 s\u22121 at a bias potential of 1.0V (vs. SCE) under illumination, that was consistent with results of IPCE (%) measurements (the maximum IPCE up to 30.02% at 325nm wavelength). The synergetic effect was quantified at current/time curves at bias potentials of 0.03mA/0V and 3.0mA/1.0V, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements revealed the electron lifetime \u03c4 el of photoexcited electrons in photoanodes was increased about 3.2 times after CN doping treatment. The bias potential could separate photo-generated holes and electrons effectively and enhance the electrochemical-oxidation of MO. Hydrogen generation was concurrently conducted in the cathodic chamber. After 180min of reaction time, the amount of H2 reached 3.2mmol by employing C\u2013N-TNTAs as the photoanode.", "Piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thin films with a composition near the morphotoropic phase boundary were deposited directly on cantilever-shaped stainless steel (SUS) substrates using RF-magnetron sputtering for application of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that the PZT thin films have a polycrystalline perovskite structure with a preferential orientation of (101). Cross-section morphology \u2013 observed using a scanning electron microscope \u2013 indicates that the PZT films exhibit a dense columnar structure without pores or clacks. The films\u2019 P\u2013E hysteresis loops indicate clear ferroelectricity. Based on the deflection characteristics of the cantilever, the effective piezoelectric coefficient e31 of the PZT films is measured to be \u22121.35C/m2.", "We describe a microfluidic device for the determination of the concentration of magnetic beads under continuous flow of the carrier fluid by means of the Giant Magneto-Impedance effect (GMI). The microfluidic chip is composed of a 10\u03bcl chamber situated on top of the GMI sensing material, which is inserted in a microstrip transmission line for the impedance measurements. Two different GMI materials have been used for the experiments: an amorphous ribbon and a permalloy based multilayer, sputtered onto the same polymeric material of the microfluidic chamber. Detection tests in continuous flow have been performed using solutions containing two types of beads: one made of ferromagnetic microparticles and the other made of superparamagnetic nanoparticles. A basic calculation of the magnitude of the fringe field created by the beads assures a detectable signal on the sensors, but the experimental difficulties severely condition the measurements. The results show a promising sensitivity for both types of particles but also reveal an important number of detection problems that must be overcame before the prototype become functional.", "We report on the results of the investigation of optical properties and structure of PECVD deposited thin films of hydrogenated polysilicon determined by UV\u2013Vis and IR spectroscopy. The influence of the hydrogen dilution of silane plasma at the PEVCD deposition on the film properties was investigated. The refractive index, the optical band gap energy and the microstructure of hydrogen and oxygen were analysed. The changes are discussed and correlated with the structure, the changes of the surface morphology and the hydrogen to silicon bonding. The optical band gap becomes larger than that of the undiluted sample. The results show that at dilution between 20 and 30 the transition between amorphous and crystalline phase occurs and the sample becomes a mixture of amorphous, polycrystalline phase with nano-sized grains and voids with decreasing hydrogen concentration. The presence of interstitial oxygen and oxygen bonded in surface Si\u2013OH groups was detected.", "In manufacturing amorphous silicon solar cells, thin films are deposited at high temperatures (200\u2013400\u00b0C) on a thick substrate using sputtering and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) methods. Since the thin films and substrate have different thermal expansion coefficients, cooling the system from deposition temperature to room temperature induces thermal residual stresses in both the films and substrate. In addition, these stresses, especially those having been induced in the amorphous silicon layer can change the carrier mobility and band gap energy of the silicon and consequently affect the solar cell efficiency. In this paper, a 2D finite element model is proposed to calculate these thermal residual stresses. The model is verified by the available analytical results in the literature. Then using the model, the thermal residual stresses are studied in a commercial amorphous silicon thin film solar cell for different deposition temperatures, and subsequently, the simulation results are validated with experimental results. It is shown that for the deposition temperatures of 200 and 300\u00b0C, the biaxial thermal stress reaches the values of \u2212367 and \u2212578MPa, respectively, in the amorphous silicon layer. Finally, the model is utilized to study the cyclic thermal stresses arising in the solar cell installed in Tehran as a sample city during its operational time due to the ambient temperature changes and photovoltaic process. The results are reported for different months based on the minimum and maximum temperatures published during a year. It is demonstrated that the temperature changes can induce mean stress with stress amplitude of \u2212526 and 60MPa, respectively, in the amorphous silicon layer during June, for example. The calculated loading history can be used by the manufactures in thermal fatigue life assessment of the solar cell.", "High efficiency thin-film silicon (Si) solar cells were prepared on flexible substrates by the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. To improve their performance, the microstructural, electrical, and optical properties of the core component layers including the metal rear reflectors, p- and n-type doped layers, and intrinsic absorber layers were controlled sophistically. To enable the use of flexible substrates with low heat resistance as well as to enhance light-scattering properties, nanotextured rear reflectors with a Ag/Al:Si bilayer structure were developed by dc magnetron sputtering at a low substrate temperature of below 150 \u00b0C. Highly crystalline n-doped seed layers (which effectively eliminate a defect-dense amorphous region formed in the initial growth stage of intrinsic nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) absorber layers) and p-type wide-bandgap nanocrystalline silicon carbide (nc-SiC:H) window layers (which reduce the parasitic absorption loss in the short-wavelength region and increase the open circuit voltage (VOC)) were successfully applied to enhance the performance characteristics of the solar cells. Through the combination of the developed core component layers, high conversion efficiencies of 8.84% (VOC = 0.53 V, JSC = 25.28 mA/cm2, and fill factor (FF) = 0.66, where JSC is the short circuit current) and 7.48% (VOC = 0.50 V, JSC = 21.07 mA/cm2, and FF = 0.71) were obtained for nc-Si:H solar cells fabricated on stainless steel (SUS) and polyimide substrates, respectively, at a low substrate temperature of below 150 \u00b0C. Flexible a-Si:H/nc-Si:H double-junction solar cells fabricated on SUS substrates showed a high conversion efficiency of 11.46% (VOC = 1.38 V, JSC = 11.53 mA/cm2, and FF = 0.72) when the nc-Si:H solar cells developed in this study were applied as a bottom cell.", "We demonstrate that it is possible to encapsulate ferromagnetic nanowires of Fe, FeCo and FeNi inside carbon nanotubes via chemical vapor deposition methods. These wires exhibit extremely high coercive fields when compared with the bulk phases. We review the state-of-the art characterization carried out on these novel wires and discuss the importance of having aligned arrays of carbon nanotubes filled with ferromagnetic materials, towards the development of novel magnetic storage devices. In this context, we will show from the experimental and theoretical stand points, that the wire shape, aspect ratio and inter-wire distances play a crucial role in the fabrication of novel storage components. In addition, we theoretically show that pure carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotori, perforated fullerenes and nanoporous graphitic structures, exhibiting negative Gaussian curvature introduced by the presence of non-hexagonal rings, behave as strong paramagnets experiencing large magnetic moments when an external magnetic field is applied. The latter results could explain some of the magnetic properties observed experimentally in carbon nanofoams and polymerized C60 phases. We envisage that magnetism in different families of nanostructures will be playing a key role in the development of emerging technologies in the present century.", "BiFeO3 ceramics were sintered in the temperature range of 700\u2013900 \u00b0C by using the pure BiFeO3 powders hydrothermally synthesized at 250 \u00b0C. The low reaction temperature and low sintering temperature prevent the element volatilization and phase decomposition. The ceramics sintered at 800 and 850 \u00b0C exhibit much dense microstructure with clear grains and grain boundaries. They also show high dielectric constant, dielectric dispersion and low loss tangent. At room temperature, the dielectric behaviors of BiFeO3 ceramics are mainly attributed to the transition of localized charge carriers and the microstructure of grains and grain boundaries. The temperature dependence of dielectric constant and loss tangent confirms that the localized charge carriers are a main contribution to the dielectric permittivity. Activation energy E\u03b1 of relaxation process for the BiFeO3 ceramic sintered at 850 \u00b0C is 0.397 eV. The obtained BiFeO3 ceramics show magnetic responses, which are relative to the grain size.", "A set of In2Se3 films was grown on (111) Si substrate with AlN buffer by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using H2Se as the metalogramic precursors for Se. The In2Se3 films on (111) Si substrate were pinhole-free with homogeneous and lamellar structures. It was found that by properly controlling the substrate temperatures, single-phase \u03b3-In2Se3 films with fairly good optical properties can be well fabricated. Photoluminescence spectra of single-phase \u03b3-In2Se3 show exciton emissions at 2.140eV at 10K. The band gap of single-phase \u03b3-In2Se3 at room temperature is estimated at 1.943eV.", "Aluminum-doped zinc oxide films were deposited at 100\u00b0C on polyethylene terephthalate by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The sputtering parameters such as RF power and Argon working pressure were varied from 25 to 125W and from 1.1 to 0.2Pa, respectively. The structural properties of as-deposited films were analysed by X-ray diffraction, showing that all the deposited films were polycrystalline, with hexagonal structure and a strong preferred c-axis orientation (002). Full width at half maximum and grain sizes were around 0.27\u00b0 and ranged from 24 to 32nm, respectively. The strain state of the samples was also estimated from X-ray diffraction measurements, obtaining compressive stresses from 0.29 to 0.05GPa. Resistivity as low as 1.1\u00d710\u22123\u03a9cm was achieved for the film deposited at 75W and 0.2Pa, sample that showed a low strain state of \u22120.06GPa. High optical transmittance (\u223c80%) was exhibited when films were deposited at RF powers below 100W. Band gap energies ranged from 3.36 to 3.39eV and a refractive index of 1.80\u00b10.05, constant in the visible region, was also obtained.", "Nanocomposite thin films, composed of a germanium nanocrystalline phase embedded within a tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) matrix, were produced using a multisource, sequential, RF-magnetron sputter deposition technique. The influence of nanocomposite structure on the resulting optical absorption and carrier transport properties was investigated in the context of the use of such materials as functional elements in thin film photovoltaic architectures. Deposition controls and post-deposition thermal anneals were successful in modifying the phase assembly of the nanocomposites, enabling the manipulation of Ge volume fraction, nanocrystallite size and morphology, and spatial distribution within the ITO embedding phase. Modifications in semiconductor nanostructure were correlated with changes in nanocomposite spectral absorption that were consistent with quantum-size-induced variation in Ge absorption onset energy, despite the close agreement in electron affinity between the Ge and ITO components. This suggests the formation of a high band-gap (low electron affinity) interfacial phase between the Ge and ITO components of the nanocomposite. Increased free-carrier (n-type) densities and spectrally resolved photoconductivity were also associated with the presence of the Ge phase. These results emphasize the impact of local and extended length scale structure on properties of importance to photovoltaic performance in semiconductor-based nanocomposites and the utility of the sequential sputter deposition method as a means to manipulate nanocomposite structure.", "The multilayer Al/Sb thin films were deposited on quartz glass substrates using magnetron sputtering method and annealed at high temperature to obtain AlSb films. The experimental conditions were optimized to obtain the AlSb single phase. XRD measurements indicate that high-temperature annealing is necessary to form AlSb and is helpful to the grain growth of AlSb polycrystalline. The average grain size of AlSb polycrystalline increases obviously with the increase in annealing temperature when higher than 500\u00b0C. The electrical measurements show that the prepared AlSb films are p-type semiconductors with the conductivity activation energy of 0.21 and 0.01eV. The optical band gap for a typical AlSb film is 1.76eV. The obvious photovoltaic effect has been observed in TCO/CdS/AlSb/ZnTe:Cu/Au devices, which demonstrated the potential of AlSb film as the absorber layer in thin film solar cells.", "Nanostructured chalcopyrite compounds have recently been proposed as absorber materials for advanced photovoltaic devices. We have used photoreflectance (PR) to evaluate the impact of interdiffusion phenomena and the presence of native defects on the optoelectronic properties of such materials. Two model material systems have been analyzed: (i) thin layers of CuGaSe2 (Eg=1.7eV) and CuInSe2 (1.0eV) in a wide/low/wide bandgap stack that have been grown onto GaAs(001) substrates by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD); and (ii) thin In2S3 samples (Eg=2.0eV) containing small amounts of Cu that have been grown by co-evaporation (PVD) intending to form CuxInySz (Eg\u223c1.5eV) nanoclusters into the In2S3 matrix. The results have been analyzed according to the third-derivative functional form (TDFF). The valence band structure of selenide reference samples could be resolved and uneven interdiffusion of Ga and In in the layer stack could be inferred from the shift of PR-signatures. Hints of electronic confinement associated to the transitions at the low-gap region have been found in the selenide layer stack. Regarding the sulphide system, In2S3 is characterized by the presence of native deep states, as revealed by PR. The defect structure of the compound undergoes changes when incorporating Cu and no conclusive result about the presence of ternary clusters of a distinct phase could be drawn. Interdiffusion phenomena and the presence of native defects in chalcopyrites and related compounds will determine their potential use in advanced photovoltaic devices based on nanostructures.", "The effects of a Si-rich silicon oxide (SRO) layer containing silicon nanocrystals as photoluminescence down-shifter layer on a conventional Si solar cell were investigated. Two SRO layers with different thicknesses but same composition were deposited on top of Si solar cells by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and followed by high temperature annealing to precipitate silicon nanocrystals. The SRO layers absorb efficiently high energy photons (especially higher than twice Si bandgap) and emit photons at longer wavelength, which are in turn absorbed by Si. A relative increase of about 14% to the internal quantum efficiency has been observed.", "Boron doped amorphous silicon carbide/nanocrystalline silicon (p-type a-SiC/nc-Si) hybrid window layer has a great potential to improve the solar cells performance for its high optical band gap, carrier mobility and doping efficiency. Thin (<30nm) p-type a-SiC/nc-Si hybrid films have been successfully deposited by radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) from silane\u2013methane gas mixtures at a low temperature of 150\u00b0C. Raman, FT-IR and HRTEM measurements were employed to investigate the structural characteristics of hybrid structure films. High quality p-type a-SiC/nc-Si hybrid window layer with controllable nano-sized silicon crystals embedded in amorphous silicon carbide matrix was obtained. Hybrid structure films with high values of optical band gap (\u223c2.2eV) and \u03c3d (\u223c10\u22123S/cm) were achieved in high hydrogen dilution conditions with optimized doping concentrations. Applying high quality p-type window layers and intrinsic a-Si layers, both high open circuit voltage (>0.96V) and high quantum efficiency values at short wavelengths were achieved for n\u2013i\u2013p type a-Si single junction solar cell. Meanwhile, the efficiency of the amorphous silicon and silicon\u2013germanium (a-Si/a-SiGe) double junction solar cell was significantly improved to 11.8% by incorporating p-type a-SiC/nc-Si hybrid structure window layer.", "Boron doped hydrogenated multiphase silicon\u2013carbon (multiphase silicon\u2013carbon) film has been grown by a plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) method to obtain the properties of high conductivity and a low absorption coefficient. It consists of amorphous carbon, amorphous silicon and a crystalline silicon-like clustering phase. It has the advantage of reducing optical loss due to the wider band gap of amorphous carbon compared to amorphous silicon carbide. The film was fabricated in conditions of low power density with a high hydrogen flow rate to increase the ratio of the amorphous carbon. This result is able to be achieved because the reaction of Si-based and C-based radicals is suppressed by the deposition condition of low electron temperature (Te) of the plasma and the short residence time of the gases. The multiphase silicon\u2013carbon showed high electrical conductivity and a low optical absorption coefficient in the short wavelength region. Applying it for use as a front contact layer in a Si thin film solar cell, it showed an improvement in the conversion efficiency due to the increase in the quantum efficiency in the short wavelength region.", "Chalcopyrite p-type quaternary CuInxAl1\u2212xSe2 (x=0.44\u22120.74) semiconductor photoelectrodes are prepared on various substrates via the reactive selenization of radio-frequency-sputtered Cu\u2013In\u2013Al metal precursors. The influence of the aluminum content in the quaternary CuInxAl1\u2212xSe2 photoelectrodes on the structural, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of CuInxAl1\u2212xSe2 samples is investigated. X-ray diffraction patterns and energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays results reveal that the metal precursors can be converted into the tetragonal CuInxAl1\u2212xSe2 phase after the selenizations process under a Se atmosphere at a temperature of 570\u00b0C for 1h. The energy band gaps of samples are tuned by varying the aluminum content in samples. The direct energy band gap of samples increases from 1.25 to 1.8eV when the [Al]/[Al+In] molar ratio in samples increases from 0.26 to 0.56. The mobility and carrier density of samples are in the ranges of 1.06\u20135.86cm2V\u22121s\u22121 and 8.23\u00d71016\u20132.34\u00d71019cm\u22123, respectively. The sample with an [Al]/[Al+In] molar ratio of 0.34 has the highest photoelectrochemical performance in aqueous H2SO4 solution with the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPCE) and photo-enhanced ABPCE of 8.99% and 3.61% at an applied voltage of \u22121.0V vs. an Ag/AgCl electrode, respectively.", "p-Type hydrogenated silicon carbide (p-SiC:H) films were prepared using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition by systematically incorporating carbon into nanocrystalline silicon networks. The carbon content of the films was varied by adjusting the methane/silane (CH4/SiH4; RC) ratio. The chemical bonding, microstructural, and electro-optical properties of the films were investigated in detail. With increasing RC, the silicon-carbon bond density in the films increased gradually and the overall microstructure became amorphous. Through sophisticated control of the carbon content of the films during high hydrogen dilution deposition, p-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline SiC:H (p-nc-SiC:H) films with nanometer-scale Si crystallites embedded in an amorphous SiC:H matrix were obtained. The p-nc-SiC:H films had wide bandgaps larger than 2\u202feV and reduced parasitic light absorption at wavelengths below 550\u202fnm. When using wide-bandgap p-nc-SiC:H films with superior electro-optical properties as window layers in n-i-p flexible and p-i-n semi-transparent nc-Si:H solar cells, in place of conventional p-nc-Si:H layers with narrow bandgaps, enhanced cell performance was achieved because of both high open circuit voltage (VOC) and high quantum efficiency values at short wavelengths of 350\u2013550\u202fnm. The conversion efficiencies of the flexible nc-Si:H solar cells increased from 6.37% (VOC = 0.41\u202fV, JSC = 22.81\u202fmA/cm2, and FF = 68.10%, where JSC is the short-circuit current density and FF is the fill factor, respectively) to 7.89% (VOC = 0.51\u202fV, JSC = 24.04\u202fmA/cm2, and FF = 64.37%). A further increase in the conversion efficiency to 9.18% was obtained by inserting a very thin, highly-doped p-nc-SiC:H buffer layer between a low-doped p-nc-SiC:H window layer and an indium tin oxide front contact. A significant increase in the conversion efficiency from 3.66% (VOC = 0.42\u202fV, JSC = 14.83\u202fmA/cm2, and FF = 58.69%) to 4.33% (VOC = 0.45\u202fV, JSC = 17.74\u202fmA/cm2, and FF = 54.18%) was achieved with the semi-transparent nc-Si:H solar cell, with an average optical transmittance of 17.29% in the visible wavelength region of 500\u2013800\u202fnm.", "Rutile titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructures were successfully fabricated using the simple chemical bath deposition method at various deposition temperatures. These nanostructures were fabricated on (100\u00b110nm) TiO2 seed layer coated glass, which was prepared via radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at a substrate temperature of 350\u00b0C. The synthesized TiO2 nanostructures were annealed at 550\u00b0C for 2h and examined via X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), photoluminescence (PL), and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD patterns showed the presence of the peaks characteristic of rutile phase. The band gap of the TiO2 nanostructures was calculated using the UV\u2013vis absorption spectrum and was determined to be between 3.15 and 3.24eV. The Raman spectra contained three characteristic bands at 232, 446 and 612cm\u22121, which correspond to the tetragonal TiO2 rutile. The results showed good quality of nanocrystalline TiO2 rutile phase.", "The tunability in the structural and magnetic phases present in RF-sputtered Fe3Pt thin films over Si (100) substrates have been studied by introducing thin films of platinum (Pt) as an underlayer and/or overlayers. Annealing of the Fe3Pt thin films with Pt underlayers (Pt/Fe3Pt) structures at 600\u00b0C for 1h, indicates well organized nanostructured grains as imaged through an atomic force microscope (AFM). The evolution of superstructure peaks as well as the preferred orientation along (001) plane observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study is well supported by the magnetic measurements. These annealed Pt/Fe3Pt structures show high magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the presence of hard phase with a coercivity of 8.5kOe. Here, the annealing process allows the adjacent Pt atoms to diffuse into the Fe3Pt unit cells and triggers the structural transformation to chemically ordered L10 phase. An additional L12 phase is observed in the annealed Fe3Pt thin films with Pt overlayer and underlayer (Pt/Fe3Pt/Pt) tri-layered structures.", "Nanostructured ZnO and Mg doped ZnO (Mg:ZnO) thin films were prepared on c-cut sapphire substrate at 700\u00b0C by rf sputtering. The influence of Mg doping on the structural, luminescence, optical and morphological properties were investigated systematically. XRD pattern of both the films show highly c-axis oriented wurtzite hexagonal structure. A slight shift in the (002) peak position establish the effective doping of Mg into ZnO lattice. The blue shift in the PL emission for Mg:ZnO film indicates the modulation of band gap caused by Mg addition, which is also confirmed by the increase in energy gap value from 3.34 and 3.45eV. The significant change in surface morphology of the films from nanowires into nanoring, formed by a novel self assembly process, highlights the importance of Mg doping (20at.%) into ZnO.", "Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) thin films were deposited on cleaned p-type (100) oriented silicon substrates using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering method at a substrate temperatures of 200\u00b0C, 300\u00b0C, 400\u00b0C and 500\u00b0C. During deposition, sputtering pressure (PS) was maintained at 3.9\u00d710\u22123 Torr using argon (Ar) gas, and RF power (PRF) was set to a constant value of 100W for all experiments. Crystalline quality, surface morphology and band gap of the films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Experimental results showed crystalline quality, and surface morphology of the films were remarkably improved by high substrate temperature. In addition to above analyzes, SrTiO3/p-Si structure deposited at 500\u00b0C substrate temperature have been investigated using temperature dependent current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V\u2013T) characteristics in the temperature range of 110\u2013350K by steps of 30K due to its better characteristics. The ideality factor (n), barrier height (\u03a6b) and series resistance (Rs) values were extracted. Moreover, \u03a6b and Rs values were recalculated using Norde\u2019s method.", "Direct current sputtering was used to growth Al-doped ZnO (AZO) thin films at various substrate temperatures. Structural and optical properties of AZO thin films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Ultraviolet\u2013Visible\u2013Near IR spectroscopy. According to the XRD patterns, all films showed an hexagonal wurtzite structure with a preferred orientation along c-axis. EDX showed that all films are doped with 1% wt of Al. The transmittance and reflectance changed with the substrate temperature Ts . AZO has a high transmittance which is a crucial parameter for optical materials and applications. Thus, it is important to determine optical constants of the films. In this order, optical parameters such as the optical band gap, absorption coefficient, extinction coefficient, refractive index, dispersion parameter, dielectric constants and optical conductivity were studied in order to investigate the effects of Tson the optical properties of AZO thin films. The dispersion energy, single-oscillator strength and the long wavelength refractive index of the AZO thin films were found to be affected by substrate temperature Ts .", "Abstact Magnetic properties of Mn-doped ZnO (Zn0.98Mn0.02O) bulk materials prepared by the solid state reaction method were investigated by measuring magnetization as functions of temperature and magnetic field. The results indicate that the samples sintered in Ar gas show ferromagnetic behavior at room temperatures, but it disappears in samples sintered in air. Even for ferromagnetic samples, the obtained saturation value of magnetization is much smaller than theoretical value, suggesting the possibility of that there was a strong anti-ferromagnetic exchange coupling in this kind of compounds.", "Magnetic, structural and transport measurements on granular [La0.7Sr0.3MnO3]1\u2212x[Insulator]x pellets were carried out. The system displayed a conduction threshold at x>30%, i.e., for a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 volume fraction X FM \u223c70%. Beyond this value, the resistivity increased steeply, setting up a rather insulating behavior. Nevertheless, the maximum enhancement in magnetoresistance was observed at a concentration x= x c \u223c10% at low temperatures and \u223c20% at room temperature. This result was demonstrated to be independent of the applied magnetic field strength. The observed magnetoresistance enhancement seemed to be consistent with the disorder-driven amplification of spin-dependent transport at the structural boundaries of the mixture, due to the presence of the insulating material within the ferromagnetic matrix.", "A novel four-layer Bi5FeTi3O15(BFTO) compound was synthesized via sintering the mixture of Fe2O3, Bi2O3 oxides and already-prepared Bi4Ti3O12 powders. At room temperature, the remnant polarization ( 2 P r ) and the coercive field ( 2 E c ) of Bi5FeTi3O15 samples were about 11.8 \u03bcC/cm2 and 270 kV/cm, respectively. The BFTO samples show a weak ferromagnetism with M r \u22481.36\u00d71 0 \u2212 6 emu/ g. A sharp dielectric peak was found, showing that the arrangement of iron ions in each crystal unit may be relatively in order. Two peaks were found in the tan\u03b4\u2212T curves. The peak at lower temperature (\u223c400 \u2218C) behaves relaxation characteristic, with the activation energy ( H ) of about 1.62 eV and the upper peak is frequency independent.", "Morphological and magnetic characteristics of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles synthesized by sol\u2013gel auto combustion method using nitrates of respective metal ions have been studied. X-ray diffraction pattern was indexed by a Rietveld program to calculate accurate unit cell dimension. A Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) confirmed the formation of single phase cobalt ferrite nanoparticles in the range 11\u201340 nm depending on the annealing temperature and time. The size of the particles increases with annealing temperature and time while the coercivity goes through a maximum, peaking at around 25 nm. A very large coercivity (10.2 kOe) is observed on cooling down to 77 K while typical blocking effects are observed below about 260 K. The high field moment is observed to be small for smaller particles and approaches the bulk value for large particles. Mossbauer spectra recorded at room temperature is a sextet indicating that there is a strong magnetic coupling and increase in sintering temperature from 570 \u2218C to 800 \u2218C do not affect Mossbauer parameters.", "Bi85Sb15\u2212xPrx (x=0,1,2,3) alloys with partial substitution of Pr for Sb were synthesized by mechanical alloying followed by high-pressure sintering. The crystal structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were measured in the temperature range of 80\u2013300 K. The results show that the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of Pr-substituted samples are both larger than those of the reference sample, Bi85Sb15, in the whole measurement temperature range. The power factor of Bi85Sb13Pr2 reaches a maximum value of 3.83\u00d710\u22123 W K\u22122 m\u22121 at 235 K, which is about four times larger than that of the reference sample, Bi85Sb15, at the same temperature.", "Pure BiFeO3 (BFO), 15% Nd doped BFO (BNF), and 15% Nd and 2% high-valence Mn co-doped BFO (BNFM) multiferroic ceramics were prepared by a rapid liquid phase sintering technique. A structural transition from rhombohedral R3c to orthorhombic P4mm occurred in the BNF and BNFM ceramics. The co-doped BNFM ceramics exhibit the largest dielectric constant, the smallest dielectric loss and leakage current, and an improved rectangular-shaped polarization hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization as high as 31 \u03bcC/cm2, which could be attributed to the lower concentration of charge defects and the structural transition. Besides, enhanced ferromagnetism is confirmed in BNFM with a remnant magnetization of 0.075 emu/g and a coercive magnetic field of 5.8 kOe, which might be attributed to the effective suppression of the spatially modulated spin structure by the Nd and Mn co-doping.", "In this study, p\u2013n heterojunctions with La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (LSCO) and Al-doped ZnO (AZO) thin films were fabricated by the radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering technique. The LSCO/AZO heterojunction was obtained by stacking the p-type LSCO thin film on the annealed n-type AZO thin film under different Ar: O2 sputter gas ratio atmosphere. The thickness of LSCO and AZO thin films are about 400 nm and 500 nm, respectively. Good crystalline match between LSCO and AZO films was observed from the SEM and XRD analysis. The heterojunction diode clearly demonstrated rectifying behavior in the range of \u22128 to +8 V in reverse shape. The turn-on voltage of the diodes is obtained around 1.5 V and is in agreement with the value obtained from the difference in the work functions of LSCO and AZO. The band structure of the heterojunction was proposed based on the results of analysis.", "We report the low temperature electrical and magnetic properties of polypyrrole (PPy)/multiwall carbon nanotube (MWNT) coaxial composite fibrils synthesized by the electro-polymerization method. The iron-filled MWNTs were first grown by chemical vapor deposition of a mixture of liquid phase organic compound and ferrocene by the one step method. Then the PPy/MWNT fibrils were prepared by the electrochemical polymerization process. Electron microscopy studies reveal that PPy coating on the surface of nanotube is quite uniform throughout the length. The temperature dependent electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements were done from room temperature down to 5 and 10K, respectively. The room temperature resistivity (\u03c1) of PPy/MWNT composite fibril sample is \u223c3.8\u03a9cm with resistivity ratio [R5K/R300K] of \u223c300, and the analysis of \u03c1(T) in terms of reduced activation energy shows that resistivity lies in the insulating regime below 40K. The resistivity varies according to three dimensional variable range hopping mechanism at low temperature. The magnetization versus applied field (M\u2013H loop) data up to a field of 20kOe are presented, displaying ferromagnetic behavior at all temperatures with enhanced coercivities \u223c680 and 1870Oe at room temperature and 10K, respectively. The observation of enhanced coercivity is due to significant dipolar interaction among encapsulated iron nanoparticles, and their shape anisotropy contribution as well.", "CoFeB alloy films have been attracting much research interest for the applications in magnetoelectronic devices. In this study, crystallization and high temperature functional properties in the sputtered CoFeB alloy films were investigated. The as-deposited alloy films were amorphous and a nanocrystalline structure was formed after annealing, confirmed by X-ray measurements. Large variation in saturation magnetization with temperature was observed in thermomagnetic measurements, reflecting the interplay between crystallization and temperature dependent magnetization in the ferromagnetic alloy film. Pronounced changes in electrical resistivity and optical reflectance with temperature were observed in the alloy film, in accompany with the structural change. The activation barrier for crystallization was determined to be 1.32eV from the electrical measurements, showing a good thermal stability of the alloy film.", "Two series of SiC/Si heterojunction diodes were fabricated from nanocrystalline-SiC (nc-SiC) grown at 300\u00b0C and 600\u00b0C on Si substrates by magnetron sputtering in hydrogen-rich plasma. Both devices show good performance with a rectification ratio of 103 and 104 at \u00b12V for the low and high temperature devices, respectively. The noticeable rectifying behavior of the diodes processed at low-temperature is due the very low leakage current originating from the relatively wide bandgap of the corresponding hydrogen-rich and non-compact nc-SiC layer. A additional short annealing (0.5h) at 380\u00b0C has allowed the drop of the ideality factor from 3.7 to 1.5, suggesting some defects recovery to a level allowing a significant contribution of the diffusion conduction mechanism to the diode forward current at low bias.", "Electron capture into insulator/silicon interface states is investigated for high-k dielectrics of Gd2O3 prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), and for HfO2 prepared by reactive sputtering, by measuring the frequency dependence of Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) capacitance. The capture cross sections are found to be thermally activated and to increase steeply with the energy depth of the interface electron states. The methodology adopted is considered useful for increasing the understanding of high-k-oxide/silicon interfaces.", "P-doped silicon nanowires (SiNWs) were directly grown from a silane, hydrogen and phosphine gas mixture on a stainless steel (316) substrate by the radio frequency Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (rf PECVD) system. These nanowires including substates were directly used as the anode electrodes of lithium secondary batteries without further treatment. The surface morphologies of P-doped SiNWs were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the phosphorus components on the surface were also detected by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Their electrochemical characteristics were studied using a galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge tester. The discharge capacity of the P-doped SiNWs exhibit above 1933 mAh g-1 after 30 cycles, as it cycled between 0 and 2.0V at the current rate of 2C. The initial discharge capacities of all of the P-doped SiNWs were higher than those of the pristine ones under various rate capabilities of 0.1C, 0.5C and 2C. The charge transfer resistance was significantly reduced by the existence of phosphorus on the surface of SiNW electrodes at the impedance spectra. The presence of the phosphorus component in the SiNWs significantly improved the electrochemical performance due to reduced interfacial resistance.", "High quality hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), germanium (a-Ge:H) and silicon\u2013germanium (a-SiGe:H) thin films have been deposited by means of a d.c. hollow cathode system with magnetic field confinement. High purity single-crystal silicon and germanium nozzles were reactively sputtered in a high-density hollow cathode discharge of argon and hydrogen. This process avoids the use of the toxic and pyrophoric gases, germane and silane. The amorphous silicon thin films had light to dark conductivity ratios >106 with light conductivity in the 10\u22125 S/cm range. The best a-Si:H films have a Tauc band gap near 1.8 eV with an atomic hydrogen concentration of approximately 14%. The growth rate was in the 2\u20133 \u03bcm/h range. For the a-Ge:H films the FTIR results indicate that these films have hydrogen bonding as a single atom, as did the hydrogenated silicon films. The Tauc bandgap was approximately 1.0 eV for all the germanium films. A slight photoresponse was noted for these films, which were deposited at a rate of from 2 to 6 \u03bcm/h. For the a-SiGe:H films, two hollow cathodes of single crystal Si and Ge are reactively sputtered simultaneously. A description of the complete system will be presented. The optical and electronic properties of the initial films are promising. The photoresponse is dependent upon the bandgap, i.e. the germanium content, as expected. A light to dark ratio of 2600 has been achieved for a film with a bandgap of 1.53 eV. The FTIR data indicates that SiH bonds dominate over Ge:H bonds by the absence of peaks at 570 and 1880 cm\u22121.", "Silicon oxynitride thin films were deposited by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering using Si3N4 target under argon/oxygen gas mixture. The films were characterised by Rutherford Backscaterring Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy, Electron Spin Resonance and optical absorption. The influence of the oxygen/argon flow ratio, the total pressure and the power density on the composition, structure and optical properties of the deposits was studied. The film composition is mainly sensitive to the process parameters. Deposits with a composition close to SiO2 can be obtained with 5% of oxygen in the sputtering gas at 3 Pa pressure. The main IR absorption peak in the 600\u20131300 cm\u22121 range which is related to the Si\u2013O and Si\u2013N stretching modes shifts to higher frequencies as the oxygen content increases. It is linked to the difference of electron negativity between oxygen and nitrogen. The g-factor and linewidth (\u0394Hpp) values obtained by EPR investigation, seem to indicate that the film defects result from a mixture of neutral dangling bonds on silicon atoms bonded to three other atoms which could be either Si, O or N. Finally, the variation of the film composition induces modifications of its refractive index and optical gap.", "Chromium oxynitride films CrOxNy were prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering from a chromium target in Ar/O2(N2O)/N2 gas mixtures. The argon-to-nitrogen partial pressure ratio and the DC discharge power were kept constant in the experiments. By changing the gas composition the film stoichiometry can be continuously varied from CrN to Cr2O3. The film composition has been determined by Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and by elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA). From an XRD analysis it was concluded that the films consist of CrN nanocrystals in an amorphous oxide matrix. Depending on the oxygen content [O], the electronic behaviour of the films changes, accompanied by the evolution of an optical band gap, which was determined by spectral transmission and reflection measurements. The (negative) temperature coefficient at \u2248300 K of the resistivity of the films is in the range of 0.5 (CrN) to 2% K\u22121 (CrO0.5N0.7). This film property can be used for temperature-dependent resistors, for instance in thermal radiation detectors.", "In this study, PZT thin films are deposited using a novel dual-target (PZT/PbO) RF magnetron sputtering system coupled with plasma enhancement by hot filament thermionic electron emission. The plasma enhancement is expected to allow the deposition temperature to be decreased while retaining the desired properties of the PZT thin films. The influence of the intensified plasma to the structure of the deposited PZT films is investigated and correlated to its ferroelectric properties. The results show that with thermionic enhancement, high remnant and saturation polarization values of 31 \u03bcC/cm2 and 76 \u03bcC/cm2, respectively, are obtained at a deposition temperature of 550 \u00b0C if the higher PZT to PbO target power ratio is used; polarization behavior is not observed for the same deposition temperature without thermionic support. For the lower PZT to PbO target power ratio, improved polarization behavior is observed for the coating deposited at 580 \u00b0C with thermionic support. Moreover, film growth rate at this power ratio is increased on average by a factor of 1.7 with thermionic enhancement. This study presents the possibility of utilizing a thermionically enhanced plasma to aid in the deposition of ferroelectric PZT thin films by allowing either the deposition time or temperature to be reduced.", "Nickel oxide is a typical p-type semiconductor which has a wide range of applications due to its particular electrical, optical, and magnetic properties. However, the electrical conductivity of sputtered NiO film is unstable in the humid air and decay rapidly (electrical aging) with time. From the view point of application, trying to stabilize the electrical conductivity of NiO films is essential. In this paper, the stability of NiO films was improved by heating substrate. The result shows that the aging rate has obviously slowed down as the NiO films were deposited at the elevated temperatures of 200 \u00b0C and 300 \u00b0C. This improvement has strong relationship to the surface structure of the film. The preferred orientation of NiO film changes from (111) to (200) as the substrate temperature is increased and this change occurs progressively in NiO film from the topmost surface to the bottom material adjacent to the substrate. It is found that the electrical aging of sputtered NiO film could be depressed with forming advantageous (200) planes by elevating substrate temperature.", "Thin films of lithium cobalt oxide were deposited on Pt or Pt/Ti/quartz glass substrates by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at the substrate temperatures from room temperature to 500\u00b0C. As the substrate temperature increased, the film structure changed from amorphous structure to crystallinity with a strong (003) texture as characterized by X-ray diffraction. The surface morphology and cross-section were observed using scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the films tended to crack at a high substrate temperature. Charge\u2013discharge tests of these films were conducted and compared. The different electrochemical characteristics of these films were attributed to the modified crystallography, morphology, and thermal stress. The LiCoO2 film deposited at 400\u00b0C showed a well-defined 4.0V voltage plateau on charge and a 3.9V plateau on discharge, and delivered 54.5\u03bcAh/cm2\u03bcm at the first discharge capacity, with good cycling performance, giving evidence that such films could be used as the thin film cathodes for lithium microbatteries.", "High entropy alloys (HEAs), containing five to thirteen metallic elements, with a concentration in the range of 5 to 35% for each element, exhibit very interesting properties (mechanical, tribological, formability, magnetism...). Their high mixing entropy promotes the formation of random solid solutions, amorphous alloys or nanocrystallized structures. Bulk pieces of these alloys are known to be stable at relatively high temperature (until 800\u00b0C). We study the stability of AlCoCrCuFeNi thin film at temperatures in the range 110\u2013810\u00b0C. HEA thin films are deposited by magnetron sputtering from mosaic targets. In-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) performed during annealing evidences damages of the film above 510\u00b0C depending on the initial structure (or chemical composition) of the as-deposited HEA. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis carried out before and after annealing show that partial evaporation of the thin film, crystalline phase transformation and chemical reaction with the substrate may take place during annealing.", "TiO2 thin films were deposited by reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering of Ti target at low working pressure (1mTorr) and various O2 and Ar flow ratios (RO2=O2/(O2+Ar)). Properties of TiO2 films were measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, UV\u2013VIS transmission spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and evaluated by contact angle analysis. Well defined columnar structure with rough surface was obtained at relatively lower RO2. As RO2 increased, the oxygen vacancies in the films decreased and the stoichiometric ratio of O/Ti changed from 1.79 to 1.98. Transition from anatase to rutile phase was observed with increase in RO2. The optical bandgap showed a red shift with increase in RO2. In addition, the film with co-existing of rutile and anatase showed a high Urbach tail. Lower RO2 resulted in higher photo-hydrophilicizing efficiency due to the change in morphology, structure and composition. However, very low RO2 (less than 10%), which led to transition mode, resulted in poor photo-hydrophilicizing efficiency.", "This paper reviews a series of studies on alloying of sputtered TiC coatings with weak carbide-forming metals, Me, such as Al, Fe, Ni, Pt and Cu. Metastable solid solutions with Me on the Ti sites are easily obtained by magnetron sputtering at low temperatures (<300\u00b0C). First principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of such carbides show that a driving force exists to remove carbon from the structure as an alternative and kinetically more favourable route compared to Me precipitation. This leads to a situation where additional control of the phase composition is given by annealing: both direct influence during film growth, as well as through subsequent annealing. Thus, alloying of the nanocomposite with weak carbide-forming metals can be used to tune many mechanical, electric and magnetic properties of a carbide-based nanocomposite film.", "The impedance spectroscopy (IS) and electrical equivalent circuit method were used to investigate both electric and structural properties of materials. The analysis of a hydroxyapatite SPS sprayed layer allowed the determination of the degree of amorphousness. The difference between impedance spectra of dry and moist samples allowed the comparison of samples in terms of their porosity. Results of measurements of barium titanate nanoceramics were presented. The content of amorphous and crystalline phases was found to be dependent on the ceramic grain size. The Curie effect was observed in the crystalline phase which proved that it preserved its ferroelectric properties in spite of nanometre-sized grains.", "TiO2 thin films have been deposited at different Ar:O2 gas ratios (20:80,70:30,50:50,and 40:60 in sccm) by rf reactive magnetron sputtering at a constant power of 200W. The formation of TiO2 was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The oxygen percentage in the films was found to increase with an increase in oxygen partial pressure during deposition. The oxygen content in the film was estimated from XPS measurement. Band gap of the films was calculated from the UV\u2013Visible transmittance spectra. Increase in oxygen content in the films showed substantial increase in optical band gap from 2.8eV to 3.78eV. The Ar:O2 gas ratio was found to affect the particle size of the films determined by a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The particle size was found to be varying between 10 and 25nm. The bactericidal efficiency of the deposited films was investigated using Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells under 1h UV irradiation. The growth of E. coli cells was estimated through the Optical Density measurement by UV\u2013Visible absorbance spectra. The qualitative analysis of the bactericidal efficiency of the deposited films after UV irradiation was observed through SEM. A correlation between the optical band gap, particle size and bactericidal efficiency of the TiO2 films at different argon:oxygen gas ratio has been studied.", "Strong adherent electroactive conductive polymer films of poly(o-phenylenediamine) (PoPD) have been electrodeposited on mild steel (MS) by potentiodynamic method using 0.1M oxalic acid solution in 0.05M of o-phenylenediamine (o-PD) monomer. Thin, adherent and transparent layers of PoPD contains ladder conductive polymer structure with phenazine skeleton were confirmed by Fourier Transform Infra Red (FT-IR) and Ultra Violet visible (UV\u2013vis) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis. The corrosion protection performance of the PoPD coatings on MS in 0.5M hydrochloric acid (HCl) was investigated using Open Circuit Potential (OCP), potentiodynamic polarization and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic (EIS) measurements. OCP and polarization measurements have shown that the MS coated with PoPD maintain the potential in the passive state whereas the uncoated MS exhibit potentials in the active state indicating that significant protection is achieved by the polymer coating. High charge transfer resistance (Rct) and low double layer capacitance (Cdl) values from EIS suggest that the PoPD film exhibits excellent corrosion inhibition behavior on MS in acid environment.", "The photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) coating in the anatase crystalline structure deposited on aluminium AA1050 alloy and stainless steel S316L substrates were investigated. The coating was prepared by DC magnetron sputtering. The microstructure and surface morphology of the coating were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The photocatalytic behaviour was studied using electrochemical methods such as open circuit potential measurements, linear sweep voltammetry, impedance measurements. The microstructure and surface morphology of the coating were similar irrespective of the nature of the substrate, while the photocatalytic behaviour was found to vary depending on the substrate type. In general the TiO2 coating on stainless steel was shown to be more photocatalytically active than TiO2 on aluminium. Impedance measurements show higher capacitance for the coating on stainless steel. Mott\u2013Schottky plots indicate multiple donor states for the coating on the stainless steel substrate. The optical reflection spectrometry measurements showed a lower band gap of 0.2eV for the coating on the stainless steel substrate.", "Inductively Coupled Impulse Sputtering (ICIS) removes the need for a magnetron, whilst delivering equal or higher ion-to-neutral ratios compared to other ionised PVD technologies such as High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HIPIMS). This is especially advantageous for the sputtering of magnetic materials, as these would shunt the magnetic field of the magnetron, thus reducing the efficiency of the sputtering and ionisation process. ICIS produces highly ionised metal-dominated plasma inside a high power pulsed RF-coil with a magnet free high voltage pulsed DC powered cathode. ICIS operation with magnetic target materials has not been attempted so far. The paper aims to clarify the effects of power and pressure on the chemistry of the deposition flux and is the first investigation of the microstructure of ICIS deposited coatings. Modelling based on the intensity of the optical emission spectra (OES) is conducted for the first time on the excited species of Ni and Ar in relation to the applied RF-power. Sputtered species show a linear intensity increase for increasing peak RF-power and constant process gas pressure. The influence of increasing process gas pressure on the ionisation was studied at a constant peak RF-power for pressures. For pressures below 8Pa the intensity rises, but then remains constant for pressures up to 26Pa. The microstructure of Ni coatings shows columnar dendritic or globular growth depending on the ionisation degree. In relation to the film thickness on the top of the substrate, the bottom coverage of unbiased vias with an aspect ratio of 4:1 was 15% and for lower aspect ratios of 1.5:1 was 47.5%. The current work has shown that the concept of combining a pulsed RF driven coil with a magnet-free pulsed DC powered cathode works well for the sputtering of magnetic material in a stable plasma.", "In this work, we studied phase formation, structural and magnetic properties of iron-nitride (Fe-N) thin films deposited using high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and direct current magnetron sputtering (dc-MS) techniques. The nitrogen partial pressure during deposition was systematically varied both in HiPIMS and dc-MS processes. Resulting Fe-N films were characterized for their microstructure, magnetic properties and nitrogen concentration. We found that HiPIMS deposited Fe-N thin films show improved soft magnetic properties and likely to possess globular nanocrystalline microstructure. In addition, it was found that the nitrogen reactivity with Fe get suppressed in HiPIMS discharge as compared to that in dc-MS plasma. Obtained results can be understood in terms of distinct plasma properties of HiPIMS discharge.", "Indium sulfide (In2S3) layers were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering process with different thickness. The effect of thickness on structural, morphological, optical and photo-conductive properties of the In2S3 layers has been studied. In2S3 layers exhibit near stoichiometric chemical composition and single tetragonal phase with (103) preferred orientation. Variation of surface morphology, Raman bands and optical transmittance of the films have been observed with the increase of film thickness. Energy band gap of the layers determined from transmittance spectra were 2.44\u20132.66eV (direct) and 1.82\u20132.06eV (indirect), respectively. Based on the measured optical constants (n and k), the Wemple\u2013DiDomenico model was performed to determine values of single oscillator energy (Eo), dispersion energy (Ed), optical band gap (Eg) and high frequency dielectric constant (\u03b5\u221e). The determined \u03b2 parameter indicates In2S3 as an ionic compound. The \u03b5\u221e values agree well with that of calculated according to the Spitzer\u2013Fan model. Photoconductivity properties of the films were analyzed relating to the rate competition among photo-generation, recombination and trapping of carriers.", "We show that it is possible to manipulate the stoichiometry and composition of the thin films deposited by reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) by the design of the discharge pulsing scheme. This is illustrated for the case of the short-pulse HiPIMS of a pure Zn target in Ar/N2/O2 mixture gas (low content of O2), where the variation of the discharge pulsing frequency has led to depositions of crystalline ZnOxNy thin films with the nitrogen content and optical band gap values ranging from 0 to 6.2at.% and from 3.34 to 1.67eV, respectively. The fine control of nitrogen content in the deposited ZnOxNy thin films was obtained by the use of smooth transitions of the reactive HiPIMS discharge between the compound and metallic target sputtering modes. Thus, the yield of the sputtered metal atoms was controlled by the discharge pulsing frequency from low values, in the compound target sputtering mode, to large values, in the metallic target sputtering mode. The controlled amount of metal atoms in the gas phase and the limited amount of oxygen in the deposition chamber determined depositions of films with variable content of nitrogen.", "Thin films of titanium dioxide (TiO2) are important high refractive index coatings in optical multilayer stacks. Especially interesting is the rutile crystalline phase of TiO2 films because it's refractive index in the range of 2.6\u20262.7 is the highest available refractive index of materials being transparent in the visible and near infrared wavelength region. Rutile TiO2 films in optical interference coatings therefore in principle allow achieving the desired optical function with a lower number of layers and a simpler design compared to alternative high index materials. However the crystalline growth of TiO2 layers usually starts with an amorphous start layer of typically 40nm thickness before going over to an anatase or rutile crystalline structure. The amorphous start layer typically has a refractive index in the range of 2.4\u20262.5. This significant difference to the index of the rutile film leads to a typical gradient in the refractive index of TiO2 single layers and makes application of TiO2 films in precision optics practically difficult. The paper explores the possibilities of obtaining rutile TiO2 films right from the beginning of film growth by significantly increasing energetic ion bombardment of the growing film and adatom mobility. The influence of a variety of process parameters such as substrate temperature, deposition pressure, magnetic field strength and RF bias is investigated. The main focus of investigations was the comparison of a standard pulse process, a pulsed process with significantly increased pulse current and a pulse process in genuine high power pulsed (HiPIMS) mode. Film deposition was done by stationary sputtering using the double ring magnetron (DRM). Film characterization was carried out by XRD as well as by spectroscopic ellipsometry and photometry. Total optical losses were characterized by cavity-ring-down spectroscopy (CRD) and absorption was measured by laser induced deflection. Results show that in a rather narrow range of process parameters the desired crystalline growth of TiO2 with the rutile phase throughout the film can be obtained. This parameter set includes both the pulsed process with significantly increased pulse current and the genuine HiPIMS mode, but in all cases requires a combination with substrate heating, RF substrate bias and adapted process pressure. A significant reduction of crystallite size and scattering losses was achieved by adding a small amount of silicon dioxide (SiO2) to the film.", "The present study concerns the deposition of perovskite oxynitride SrTaO2N films and their dielectric characterization at low frequencies. Those radio frequency sputtered thin films have been obtained under a reactive plasma (92.3vol.% Ar/7.7vol.% N2) for substrate temperatures ranging from 600 to 900\u00b0C. As shown by X-rays diffraction and band-gap measurements, the deposition temperature (TS) determines the film structure and leads to films with band-gap and cell volume approaching the ones of the SrTaO2N bulk material with increased TS. The dielectric study has been performed on polycrystalline, textured and epitaxial SrTaO2N layers deposited on conductive niobium doped SrTiO3 substrates and thickness of films ranging from 30 to 900nm. The related permittivities vary from 66.5 to 90 (@10kHz, room temperature). These low values do not point out an effect of the crystallographic strain of films, due to their thickness, on the permittivity values. The latter remains irrespective of the frequency up to 100kHz and does not vary upon the application of an external DC voltage.", "A new type of amperometric glucose biosensor based on silicon dioxide coated magnetic nanoparticle decorated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Fe3O4@SiO2/MWNTs) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has been developed. MWNTs have been synthesized by catalytic chemical vapour decomposition (CCVD) of acetylene over rare earth (RE) based AB3 alloy hydride catalyst. The as-grown MWNTs have been purified and further functionlized. Functionalized MWNTs have been decorated with magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles which have been uniformly coated with biocompatible SiO2 using a simple chemical reduction method. The characterization of magnetic nanoparticle modified MWNTs have been done by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and UV\u2013vis spectroscopy. Amperometric biosensor has been fabricated by the deposition of glucose oxidase (GOD) over Nafion-solubilized Fe3O4@SiO2/MWNTs electrode. The resultant bioelectrode retains its biocatalytic activity and offers fast and sensitive glucose quantification. The performance of the biosensor has been studied using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry and the results have been discussed. The fabricated glucose biosensor exhibits a linear response from 1\u03bcM to 30mM with an excellent detection limit of 800nM indicating the potential applications in food industries.", "The thermal transformation under vacuum and the reduction behavior in hydrogen atmosphere of 2- and 6-line ferrihydrite (FeOOH\u00b7nH2O) as well as 2-line FeOOH\u00b7nH2O deposited onto silica are reported. The investigation methods include magnetization measurements, temperature programmed reduction, in-situ X-ray diffraction and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. The thermal transformation of FeOOH\u00b7nH2O to hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3) was monitored through changes in the magnetization as a function of temperature; it appears to proceed through the loss of the lattice water and sintering accompanied by improved crystallinity and structural changes. Such a transformation is initiated at T \u223c580K for 2-line and 6-line FeOOH\u00b7nH2O and at T \u223c660K for 2-line FeOOH\u00b7nH2O/SiO2, i.e., the presence of SiO2 appears to inhibit the transformation. SiO2 also tends to prevent the increase of the crystallite size above a certain threshold value. Reduction reactions are initiated at relatively lower temperatures (\u223c480K) implying that a gaseous environment facilitates the thermal dehydration/dehydroxylation process. Three different reduction mechanisms of FeOOH\u00b7nH2O to metallic iron (\u03b1-Fe) are observed: a two-stage process via magnetite (Fe3O4) as an intermediate phase for 2-line FeOOH\u00b7nH2O, a three-step reduction involving Fe3O4 and w\u00fcstite (FeO) as intermediate phases for 2-line FeOOH\u00b7nH2O/SiO2 and a thermal transformation to \u03b1-Fe2O3 followed by a two-step reduction via Fe3O4 intermediate for 6-line FeOOH\u00b7nH2O. It is inferred that SiO2 interacts with Fe species to form Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe structures which tend to inhibit the thermal transformation and resist the reduction.", "CoPt films were prepared on MgO(001) substrates at 230 \u00b0C by d.c. sputtering. Both films on the unbiased and the biased (\u2212150 V) substrates grow with the crystallographic orientation of CoPt(001)[100]//MgO(001)[100]. In fact, the unbiased film is deformed from the perfect face-centered cubic (fcc) structure towards the face-centered tetragonal (fct) structure with an incomplete ordered phase, while the biased film retains normally the fcc structure. Both films show the in-plane magnetic anisotropy with coercivity less than 1000 Oe. Upon the thermal anneal at 800 \u00b0C\u00d730 min, the unbiased film is transformed completely into the L1o-fct structure while the biased film is transformed into the fct structure but not completely into the complete L1o structure. The unbiased film shows clearly the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with the squareness equal to unity, while the biased film shows only the weaker perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with the squareness less than 0.7. The perpendicular coercivity is estimated at 3200 Oe for the unbiased film and 2200 Oe for the biased film.", "The optical functions of amorphous silicon thin films have been studied with spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) in the temperature range from 290 to 520 K. The ellipsometry data were modeled using Tauc\u2013Lorentz dispersion law for amorphous materials. It has been found that the temperature coefficients of Tauc\u2013Lorentz parameters, such as the optical gap, are rather similar for four different materials, which suggests that the obtained values are valid for a broad range of amorphous silicon-based materials and can be used to determine the surface temperature by ellipsometry. A practical example of using spectroscopic ellipsometry for in situ temperature measurements in the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition environment is given.", "The magnetic properties and structures of FePt and FePt/Ag thin films deposited by DC and RF magnetron sputtering were studied. The results show that the coercivity of FePt thin films is significantly higher when the stoichiometry is near the equiatomic composition. After annealed at 550 \u00b0C for 30 min, FePt and FePt/Ag thin films become magnetically hard with coercivities in the range of 9\u201310 kOe due to high anisotropy energy associated with the L10 ordered phase. After annealing at the lower temperature of 350 \u00b0C for 1 h, FePt films without Ag underlayers were FCC disordered. When Ag underlayers were used, FePt/Ag thin films have a high in-plane coercivity of 6236 Oe. Results indicate that the Ag underlayers are able to reduce the ordering temperature of FePt films. Furthermore, it was found that coercivities of FePt/Ag thin films strongly depend on the sputtering pressure of Ag underlayers. Ag underlayers can slightly reduce the intergranular exchange interactions of the FePt magnetic recording films.", "Copper, silver, and gold targets were sputtered in various reactive gas mixtures (Ar\u2013N2, Ar\u2013O2, and Ar\u2013CH4) to compare the reactivity of noble metal atoms during the sputtering process. The evolution of the film's growth rate and the variation of the reactive gas partial pressure vs. the reactive gas flow rate were investigated for each kind of metal. The structure of the deposited films was characterised by X-ray diffraction. Electrical resistivity of the coatings was determined at room temperature. The optical band gap of oxides and nitrides films were deduced from UV\u2013visible transmission measurements. The reactive sputtering of copper target leads to the synthesis of Cu3N, Cu2O, Cu4O3, or CuO films. No copper carbide films were deposited. Depending on the methane flow rate, Cu/C films were either nanocomposite coatings (nc-Cu/a-C:H) or amorphous. Silver oxide (Ag2O) films were formed by reactive sputtering of a silver target in Ar\u2013O2 mixtures. On the other hand, the reactive sputtering method did not allow the synthesis of silver nitride nor gold oxide films.", "Thin films of cadmium tin oxide (Cd2SnO4) have been deposited on glass substrates by RF magnetron co-sputtering from cadmium oxide (CdO) and tin oxide (SnO2) targets in an Argon ambient. Co-sputtering offers a means to control the atomic stoichiometry of Cd2SnO4, which influences the material's electro-optical and structural properties. The Cd2SnO4 films were deposited at room temperature and subsequently subjected to a heat treatment in inert or reducing (H2) ambient. The as-deposited films were amorphous, and became polycrystalline after annealing at high temperatures. Using this method, Cd2SnO4 films with a Hall mobility of 32.3 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and a carrier concentration of 7.40\u00d71020 cm\u22123 corresponding to a resistivity of 2.07\u00d710\u22124 \u03a9 cm have been prepared. The films exhibited average optical total transmission in excess of 90% in the visible region. The optical bandgap was found to be in the range of 2.97\u20133.18 eV, depending on post deposition treatment.", "Amorphous carbon film (a-C:H) deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition is a potential candidate of low-k material for the requirements of ULSI device. The bonding structure and element of a-C:H films influence dielectric property dramatically. Para-xylene was utilized as carbon precursor added with acetylene to deposit a-C:H films at ambient temperature. The bonding type, network structure and optical gap of films were analyzed by FT-IR, Raman and UV\u2013Visible spectroscopy, respectively. The purpose is to determine the influences of acetylene concentration on the structures and bonding types of amorphous carbon film. The results show that the increases of acetylene concentration and deposition power increase the deposition rate but decrease the optical gap and density. Thus, the films deposited with sp2 and sp3 hydrocarbon bonds have lower polarized bonds and porous structure of low density, which are both responsible for the variation of dielectric constant.", "A systematic study of the influence of alumina (Al2O3) doping on the optical, electrical, and structural characteristics of sputtered ZnO thin films is reported in this study. The ZnO thin films were prepared on 1737F Corning glass substrates by R.F. magnetron sputtering from a ZnO target mixed with Al2O3 of 0\u20134 wt.%. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrates that the ZnO thin films with Al2O3 of 0\u20134 wt.% have a highly (002) preferred orientation with only one intense diffraction peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) less than 0.5\u00b0. The electrical properties of the Al2O3-doped ZnO thin films appear to be strongly dependent on the Al2O3 concentration. The resistivity of the films decreases from 74 \u03a9\u00b7cm to 2.2\u00d710\u22123 \u03a9\u00b7cm as the Al2O3 content increases from 0 to 4 wt.%. The optical transmittance of the Al2O3-doped ZnO thin films is studied as a function of wavelength in the range 200\u2013800 nm. It exhibits high transparency in the visible-NIR wavelength region with some interference fringes and sharp ultraviolet absorption edges. The optical bandgap of the Al2O3-doped ZnO thin films show a short-wavelength shift with increasing of Al2O3 content.", "Indium molybdenum oxide thin films were RF sputtered at room temperature on glass substrates with a reference base pressure of 7.5\u00d710\u22124 Pa. The electrical and optical properties of the films were studied as a function of oxygen partial pressures (OPP) ranging from 1.5\u00d710\u22123 Pa to 3.5\u00d710\u22123 Pa. The obtained data show that the bulk resistivity of the films increased by about 4 orders of magnitude (from 7.9\u00d710\u22123 to 7.6\u00d7101 \u03a9-cm) when the OPP increased from 1.5\u00d710\u22123 to 3.5\u00d710\u22123 Pa, and the carrier concentration decreased by about 4 orders (from 1.77\u00d71020 to 2.31\u00d71016 cm\u22123). On the other hand, the average visible transmittance of 30.54% of the films (brown colour; OPP=1.5\u00d710\u22123 Pa) was increased with increasing OPP to a maximum of 80.47% (OPP=3.5\u00d710\u22123 Pa). The optical band gap calculated from the absorption edge of the transmittance spectra ranges from 3.77 to 3.88 eV. Further, the optical and electrical properties of the films differ from those deposited at similar conditions but with a base pressure lower than 7.5\u00d710\u22124 Pa.", "A systematic study of the effect of sputtering deposition parameters on structural, optical, and electrical properties of the aluminium-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) films was carried out. ZnO:Al films deposited in the temperature range of 25 \u00b0C to 150 \u00b0C contain crystallites with a strong preferred orientation in the (001) direction. The crystallite size is significantly affected by the substrate temperature, while the effect of the rf power and chamber pressure on the crystallite size is less pronounced. The largest crystallite size of 300 nm was determined in films deposited in the range of 75 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C. The increasing substrate temperature enhances the doping efficiency resulting in films with a lower resistivity and a wider optical gap. The use of the optimal sputtering conditions (75 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C, 0.1 Pa and 800 W) for depositing a ZnO:Al back reflector in a-Si:H solar cells resulted in an S-shaped current density\u2013voltage characteristics and a low fill factor. By applying an increased chamber pressure of 2.5 Pa during sputtering of the ZnO:Al a relative increase of 10% in the solar cell efficiency was achieved in comparison to the cell without the ZnO:Al. The improvement resulted mainly from an increase in the short-circuit current density by \u223c1.3 mA/cm2.", "Thin films of the semiconductor scandium nitride were deposited onto sapphire substrates using reactive magnetron sputtering. Increasing concentrations of oxygen were introduced into the ScN films via increasing the residual base pressure in the deposition chamber prior to introduction of the reactive Ar/N2 sputtering gas mixture. Films showed significant oxygen contamination even when deposited using base pressures of 10\u22126 Pa. Increasing levels of contamination degrade the crystalline quality of the films. Oxygen contamination also contributes to the non-Arrhenius behaviour of film resistivity versus temperature and ultimately results in degenerate n-type conductivity in the ScN films. Oxygen incorporation in ScN increases the direct band gaps from 2.2 eV to 3.1 eV and may therefore be a contributing reason for the wide range of direct band gaps experimentally determined for this material. Comparison with TiN and ZrN films deposited under similar conditions shows that ScN displays a comparatively high oxygen affinity. The results imply that the production of ScN films possessing high crystalline quality and non-degenerate electrical properties requires the use of deposition techniques involving ultra-high vacuum conditions or other low-oxygen environments.", "The low cost, environmental harmless Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)-based thin film solar cells are fabricated by using abundant materials. The CZTS film possesses promising characteristic optical properties; band-gap energy of about 1.5 eV and large absorption coefficient in the order of 104 cm\u22121. All constituents of this CZTS film, which are abundant in the crust of the earth, are non-toxic. Therefore, if we can use CZTS film practically as the absorber of solar cells, we will be free from both of the resource saving problem and the environmental pollution. In our CZTS project, CZTS absorber films were prepared by two independent techniques. One is three rf sources co-sputtering followed by annealing in sulfurized atmosphere. The latest conversion efficiency of over 6.7% was achieved by this technique. The other is co-evaporation technique. CZTS films were grown on Si (100) by vacuum co-evaporation using elemental Cu, Sn, S and binary ZnS as sources. XRD patterns indicated that the polycrystalline growth was suppressed and the orientational growth was relatively induced in a film grown at higher temperatures. In this presentation, the development of CZTS-based thin film solar cells will be surveyed.", "Thin-film solar cells based on Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorbers were fabricated successfully by solid-state reaction in H2S atmosphere of electrodeposited Cu\u2013Zn\u2013Sn precursors. These ternary alloys were deposited in one step from a cyanide-free alkaline electrolyte containing Cu(II), Zn(II) and Sn(IV) metal salts on Mo-coated glass substrates. The solar cell was completed by a chemical bath-deposited CdS buffer layer and a sputtered i-ZnO/ZnO:Al bilayer. The best solar cell performance was obtained with Cu-poor samples. A total area (0.5 cm2) efficiency of 3.4% is achieved (Voc=563 mV, jsc=14.8 mA/cm2, FF=41%) with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 80%. The estimated band-gap energy from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements is about 1.54 eV. Electron backscatter-diffraction maps of cross-section samples revealed CZTS grain sizes of up to 10 \u00b5m. Elemental distribution maps of the CZTS absorber show Zn-rich precipitates, probably ZnS, and a Zn-poor region, presumably Cu2SnS3, close to the interface Mo/CZTS.", "Bismuth telluride films were prepared via radio frequency magnetron sputtering. Mixed powders with different composition were used as sputtering targets. Influence of the annealing temperature on surface topography, crystal structure and thermoelectric properties of the films has been investigated. It was found that the grain size increased and the surface roughness decreased with a rising annealing temperature. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed an improved crystallization after the annealing, and that crystal planes perpendicular to c-axis became prominent. High temperature treatments resulted in a decrease of Seebeck coefficient and an increase of electrical conductivity. The highest power factor was obtained after being annealed at 300 \u00b0C.", "In this study, we attempted to reduce firing voltage of ac-PDPs by alloying MgO electron emission material with ZnO. This approach was aimed to reduce band gap energy of MgO by the alloying and thereby promote the Auger neutralization reaction of Xe+ ions on MgO surface. Pellets were prepared by sintering MgO and ZnO powder mixture at 1300 \u00b0C for 8 h under nitrogen atmosphere. Test panels with such alloyed MgO films showed significantly reduced firing voltages, especially when the discharge gas is of high Xe content. These results represent a new way of approaching in the development of electron emission materials for ac-PDPs.", "Multiferroic BiFeO3 films of smooth surface and fully-saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loops have been grown by RF magnetron sputtering. The (001)-oriented epitaxial films showed a large remanent polarisation of 61 \u00b5C/cm2. A strategy to grow BiFeO3 films of good ferroelectric property was demonstrated, that was using fast growth rate to achieve accurate stoichiometry for the BiFeO3 phase and at the same time to avoid the formation of impurity phases associated with the fast growth by accurate control of thermodynamic parameters such as oxygen partial pressure and temperature, as well as proper selection of substrates. Piezoresponse force microscopy revealed fine spontaneous domains for highly resistive epitaxial films, which were switchable under DC biases. For the polycrystalline films of increased density of free carriers, single-domain grains of about 200 nm in diameter were observed due to effective compensation of depolarisation field by free carriers and therefore allowing larger domains.", "Epitaxial chromium dioxide (CrO2) thin films have been deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on (100) TiO2 substrates using the precursor chromium hexacarbonyl (Cr(CO)6) within a narrow temperature window of 380\u2013400\u00b0C. Normal \u03b8\u20132\u03b8 Bragg x-ray diffraction results show that the predominant phase is CrO2 with only a small amount of Cr2O3 present, mostly at the film surface. The LPCVD films have a reasonably smooth surface morphology with a root mean square roughness of 4nm on a scale of 5\u03bcm. Raman spectroscopy confirms the existence of rutile CrO2 in the deposited films, while transmission electron microscopy confirms the single-crystalline nature of the films. The LPCVD films showing a dominant CrO2 phase exhibit clear uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with the easy axis oriented along the c direction.", "Tungsten oxide (WO3) nanowires with diameters of 15\u201340nm and lengths of hundreds of nanometers were synthesized by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) without using any catalyst in a low-temperature zone (200\u2013300\u00b0C) of a tube furnace via a two-step heating process. The morphology, composition, and crystal structure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman, ultraviolet UV\u2013visible, and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy. XRD and TEM confirmed that the nanowires were triclinic WO3 with growth direction along [001]. Blue emission was observed in both the UV\u2013visible and CL spectrum, indicating that the WO3 nanowires exhibited a red-shift at an optical absorption wavelength due to oxygen deficiencies. The crystallinity and size distribution of the nanowires influenced the bandgap. In the CL spectrum, the blue emission was at shorter wavelengths than reported previously, which can be attributed to the nanoscale size effect.", "Zinc oxide/indium/zinc oxide multilayer structures have been obtained on glass substrates by magnetron sputtering. The effects of indium thickness on optical and electrical properties of the multilayer structures are investigated. Compared to a single zinc oxide layer, the carrier concentration increases from 8\u00d71018cm\u22123 to 1.8\u00d71020cm\u22123 and Hall mobility decreases from 10cm2/vs to 2cm2/vs for the multilayer structure at 8nm of indium thickness. With the increase of indium thickness, the transmittance decreases and optical band gap shifts to lower energy in multilayer structures. Results are understood based on Schottky theory, interface scattering mechanism and the absorption of indium layer.", "Germanium carbide (Ge1\u2212xCx) films on silicon and quartz substrates have been prepared by the radio frequency (RF) reactive sputtering of a pure Ge target in a CH4/Ar discharge. Their structural and optical properties have been investigated as functions of the substrate temperature (TS) and the CH4 percentage to the gas mixture. The optical band gap of the films lies within the range 0.96\u20131.65eV, varying proportionally with the carbon content and in inverse proportionality with TS.", "For Co/Si(111) films thinner than 15ML, the thickness dependent reactivity and magnetic properties have been systematically studied. As the Co coverage increases, Co adatoms on the Si(111) surface show enhanced chemical reactivity for oxidation due to the change of the chemical state. After the saturation oxygen exposure, oxygen atoms interact with a thick Co layer to form a rougher interface. Complex adsorption kinetics of oxygen in the Co layer is observed. From the depth-profiling measurements for Co layers close to the Co\u2013Si interface, the sputtering rate is enhanced due to that the solid surfaces of Si and Co\u2013Si compounds are resistive against oxidation. The descending of the Kerr intensity by saturation oxygen exposure shows the limited diffusion length of oxygen atoms into the films. The inertness of the Co\u2013Si interface, the reduction of pure cobalt and imperfection introduced by oxygen influence the coercivity of O/Co/Si(111).", "The Al doping effects on high-frequency magneto-electric properties of Zn1\u2212 x \u2212 y Al x Co y O (x =0\u201310.65at.%) thin films were systematically studied. In the current work, the Zn1\u2212 x \u2212 y Al x Co y O thin films were deposited by magnetron co-sputtering onto quartz substrates. The magneto-impedance spectra of the thin films were measured by an impedance analyzer. Among all the doped films studied, the thin film with 6.03at.% Al-doping showed the highest ac conductivity and relaxation frequency. To characterize the relaxation mechanism underlying the magneto-electric properties, a Cole\u2013Cole impedance model was applied to analyze the impedance spectra. The analyzed result showed that the magneto-impedance of the Zn1\u2212 x \u2212 y Al x Co y O is contributed by multiple processes of magnetization dynamics and dielectric relaxation. The results imply that Zn1\u2212 x \u2212 y Al x Co y O may be applicable for high-frequency magneto-electric devices.", "The microstructure of Ag films was investigated as a function of the cathode voltage during sputter deposition. It was found that the resistivity of the Ag films decreased when the Ag film was deposited at low cathode voltage using a magnetron cathode with high-magnetic flux density. X-ray diffraction measurement revealed that the Ag films deposited at low cathode voltages exhibited higher crystallization degree and larger crystallites. Besides, it was confirmed from glancing incident X-ray reflectivity measurement that the density of the Ag films increased with decreasing in the cathode voltage. It can be concluded from these results that the improvements in the resistivity and microstructure of Ag films result from the low-voltage sputtering. It can be concluded that the kinetic energy of the Ar gas particles decreased with decreasing the cathode voltage; as a result, the microstructure of Ag films should be improved.", "Tin dioxide is emerging as an important material for use in copper indium gallium diselenide based solar cells. Amorphous tin dioxide may be used as a glass overlayer for covering the entire device and protecting it against water permeation. Tin dioxide is also a viable semiconductor candidate to replace the wide band gap zinc oxide window layer to improve the long-term device reliability. The film properties required by these two applications are different. Amorphous films have superior water permeation resistance while polycrystalline films generally have better charge carrier transport properties. Thus, it is important to understand how to tune the structure of tin dioxide films between amorphous and polycrystalline. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Hall-effect measurements, we have studied the structure and electrical properties of tin dioxide films deposited by magnetron sputtering as a function of deposition temperature, sputtering power, feed gas composition and film thickness. Films deposited at room temperature are semicrystalline with nanometer size SnO2 crystals embedded in an amorphous matrix. Film crystallinity increases with deposition temperature. When the films are crystalline, the X-ray diffraction intensity pattern is different than that of the powder diffraction pattern indicating that the films are textured with (101) and (211) directions oriented parallel to the surface normal. This texturing is observed on a variety of substrates including soda\u2013lime glass (SLG), Mo-coated soda\u2013lime glass and (100) silicon. Addition of oxygen to the sputtering gas, argon, increases the crystallinity and changes the orientation of the tin dioxide grains: (110) XRD intensity increases relative to the (101) and (211) diffraction peaks and this effect is observed both on Mo-coated SLG and (100) silicon wafers. Films with resistivities ranging between 8m\u03a9 cm and 800m\u03a9 cm could be deposited. The films are n-type with carrier concentrations in the 3\u00d71018cm\u22123 to 3\u00d71020cm\u22123 range. Carrier concentration decreases when the oxygen concentration in the feed gas is above 5%. Electron mobilities range from 1 to 7cm2/Vs and increase with increasing film thickness, oxygen addition to the feed gas and film crystallinity. Electron mobilities in the 1\u20133cm2/Vs range can be obtained even in semicrystalline films. Initial deposition rates range from 4nm/min at low sputtering power to 11nm/min at higher powers. However, deposition rate decreases with deposition time by as much as 30%.", "Improvement of ferroelectric property by Lanthanum (La)-doping of BiFeO3 (BFO) and strain effect of high quality superlattice films deposited at temperature \u2267700\u00b0C was shown in this study. The in-pane (200) radial scans showed that films at deposition temperature above 700\u00b0C behaved high strained ~\u22121.4% and showed epitaxity properties. The La-doped BFO superlattice structure also behaved higher polarization value ~197\u03bcC/cm2 and lower leakage current density comparing with BFO superlattice structure shown in our previous study. The ferroelectric properties of superlattice structures are enhanced by lattice strain and strongly correlated with the defect state of films.", "Structural and optical properties of the amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) thin films deposited by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition method from a mixture of silane (SiH4) and methane (CH4) diluted in argon (Ar) have been studied with variation of Ar dilution from 94% to 98.4%. It is observed that nanocrystalline silicon starts to form within the a-SiC:H matrix by increasing the dilution to 96%. With further increase in Ar dilution to 98% formation of the silicon nanocrystals (nc-Si) with variable size is enhanced. The optical band gap (Eg) of the a-SiC:H film decreases from 2.0eV to 1.9eV with increase in Ar dilution from 96% to 98% as the a-SiC:H films gradually become Si rich. On increasing the Ar dilution further to 98.4% leads to the appearance of crystalline silicon quantum dots (c-Si q-dots) of nearly uniform size of 3.5nm. The quantum confinement effect is apparent from the sharp increase in the Eg value to 2.6eV. The phase transformation phenomenon from nc-Si within the a-SiC:H films to Si q-dot were further studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and the grazing angle X-ray diffraction spectra. A relaxation in the lattice strain has been observed with the formation of Si q-dots.", "Zinc nitride (Zn3N2) films were prepared by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering from a pure Zn target in a N2 ambient. Films were deposited on glass and Si(100) substrates at 298- and 473-K substrate temperatures (T s). Ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques, spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and transmission spectroscopy were used to characterize the samples as a function of T s and time. IBA studies showed that the Zn and N concentrations matched the stoichiometric values 3:2 of the cubic anti-bixbyte structure and revealed the partial transformation of Zn3N2 into zinc oxide (ZnO) due to the exposure to ambient air. IBA and SE techniques revealed films grown at higher T s were less affected by the oxidation process. Transmission spectroscopy showed that the band gap energy blue shifted as T s decreased. It was also found that the oxidation process produced a blue shift of the band gap energy. For the sake of comparison, ZnO/Zn3N2 heterostructures were synthesized using the same system and characterized in parallel to unintentionally oxidized nitride layers. SE studies of the heterostructure showed that the deposition of a ZnO layer helped to prevent nitride oxidation.", "The effects of different radio-frequency (rf) powers on the characteristics of amorphous boron carbon (BC) thin film alloys on n-type silicon (n-Si) wafers prepared by reactive radio-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (rf-PECVD) are investigated. The reactive rf-PECVD was the combination of rf-PECVD and sputtering. Five kinds of amorphous BC thin film alloys were prepared with rf powers of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500W. Experimental results show that when the rf power increases from 100 to 500W, the deposition rate of amorphous BC thin film alloys slightly decreases from 1.14 to 1.00nm/s that is resulted from the increase of the B/C ratio. The amorphous BC thin film alloy prepared at the rf power of 300W has a maximum graphitization degree and sp2 carbon bonds, so it has the lowest energy band gap and electrical resistivity. All the amorphous BC thin film alloys prepared with different rf powers are p-type. When the amorphous BC thin film alloy prepared at the rf power of 300W, the amorphous BC/n-Si diode possesses the lowest series resistance of 279\u03a9 and an ideality factor of 4.9; after annealed at 623K, the series resistance and ideality factor of this diode reduce to 98\u03a9 and 2.47, respectively. When the amorphous BC thin film alloys were prepared at the rf power of 300W, the built-in voltages of the amorphous BC/n-Si devices are 0.45 and 0.88V for the amorphous BC thin film alloys before and after annealed at 623K, respectively. When an additional native oxide of SiO2 layer was prepared on the n-type silicon substrate surface, the power conversion efficiency and fill factor of amorphous BC/SiO2/n-Si devices are 1.04% and 88.3%, respectively. Hence, the amorphous BC thin film alloys prepared by reactive rf-PECVD have the potential applied to the fabrication of solar cells.", "Nanocrystalline monoclinic HfO2 films with an average crystal size of 4.2\u201314.8nm were sputter deposited under controlled temperatures and their structural characteristics and optical and photoluminescence properties have been evaluated. Structural investigations indicate that monoclinic HfO2 films grown at higher temperatures above 400\u00b0C are highly oriented along the (\u2212111) direction. The lattice expansion increases with diminishing HfO2 crystalline size below 6.8nm while maximum lattice expansion occurs with highly oriented monoclinic HfO2 of crystalline size about 14.8nm. The analysis of atomic force microscopy shows that the film growth at 600\u00b0C can be attributed to the surface-diffusion-dominated growth. The intensity of the shoulderlike band that initiates at ~5.7eV and saturates at 5.94eV shows continued increase with increasing crystalline size, which is intrinsic to nanocrystalline monoclinic HfO2 films. Optical band gap varies in the range 5.40\u00b10.03\u20135.60\u00b10.03eV and is slightly decreased with the increase in crystalline size. The luminescence band at 4.0eV of HfO2 films grown at room temperature can be ascribed to the vibronic transition of excited OH radical while the emission at 3.2\u20133.3eV for the films grown at all temperatures was attributed to the radiative recombination at impurity and/or defect centers.", "Transparent conducting Ga-doped ZnO films have been deposited by rf reactive magnetron co-sputtering of Zn and GaAs in Ar\u2013O2 mixture at a total flow rate of 30sccm. Ga-doped ZnO films deposited with 1% GaAs target area coverage exhibit high transparency and low electrical resistivity in a narrow operational window of substrate temperature in the range of 350\u2013400\u00b0C and 3\u20134% O2 in the sputtering gas mixture. The film deposited under optimized conditions contains low arsenic impurity (~0.1at.%) and exhibits ~80% or higher average transmittance in the visible region and electrical resistivity of ~9\u00d710\u22126\u03a9-m, which corresponds to sheet resistance of 12\u201315\u03a9/sq. The film exhibits carrier concentration ~7\u00d71026m\u22123 and Hall mobility ~10\u22123m2V\u22121s\u22121. The high carrier concentration of the film results in the appearance of plasma resonance at ~1400nm followed by high reflectance at longer wavelengths and widening of the band gap to ~3.7eV due to heavy doping effects.", "In this work, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) in the so-called piezoresponse mode (PFM) is used to image the morphology, as-growth domain structure, domain wall motion and piezoelectric loop in lithium niobate thin films. A RF magnetron sputter system was used to deposit LiNbO3 thin films on (100)-oriented Si substrates with SiO2 layer. The surface of the sample shows small grains which diameter ranges from 30nm to 50nm and roughness is less than 8nm. Ferroelectric nanodomains were created in LiNbO3 thin films by applying a voltage to a sharp conducting tip of a PFM. Using the piezoresponse mode of the SPM to detect the out-of-plane and in-plane film polarization, the domain sizes were measured as a function of the applied writing voltage and the pulse time. The dynamics of domain growth is analyzed experimentally taking into account the strong inhomogeneity of the external electric field in the film and the influence of the Si substrate.", "High-power impulse magnetron sputtering of a planar Ta target in various Ar+O2+N2 gas mixtures was investigated at an average target power density close to 50Wcm\u22122 during a deposition. A strongly unbalanced magnetron was driven by a pulsed dc power supply operating at the repetition frequency of 500Hz and the average target power density of up to 2.4kWcm\u22122 in a pulse with a fixed 50\u03bcs duration. Si(100) and glass substrates were at a floating potential, and the substrate temperatures were less than 285\u00b0C. A pulsed reactive gas (O2 and N2) flow control made it possible to produce high-quality Ta\u2013O\u2013N films of various elemental compositions with high deposition rates of 97\u2013190nm/min. The film compositions (in at.%) were varied gradually from Ta28O71 with less than 1at.% of H to Ta38O4N55 with 3at.% of H. The Ta27O40N31 films with 2at.% of H, which were produced at the 50% N2 fraction in the reactive gas flow with the highest deposition rate of 190nm/min achieved, were nanocrystalline with an optical band gap of 2.5eV and hardness of 8GPa. These films with a shift of the absorption edge to 500nm are potential candidates for application as visible-light driven photocatalysts.", "Temperature dependent Hall effect measurements were performed for the undoped CdO films with carrier concentrations (n) ranging from 2.4\u00d71019 to 2.0\u00d71020 cm\u22123 grown on c- and r-plane sapphire substrates by the atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition using Cd powder and H2O as source materials. The n dependence of the optical gap energy (E opt) could be explained by the combination of the band gap widening due to Burstein\u2013Moss shift and the band gap shrinkages due to the electron\u2013electron and electron\u2013impurity interactions. For all the films, the carrier concentrations (n) were independent of measurement temperature (T), indicating that these films were n-type degenerate semiconductors. The barrier heights at grain boundaries determined from the 1000/T-ln(\u03bcT) curves were smaller than the thermal energy at 300K, suggesting that the grain boundary scattering plays a minor role on the carrier transport in comparison with the intra-grain scattering. The n dependence of the gradient of the \u03bc\u2013T curve revealed the continuous transformation of the dominant intra-grain scattering mechanism from the phonon scattering to the ionized impurity scattering with increasing n.", "We report a growth of ZnCo2O4/Si heterostructures by using radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS) method, and characterizations of their transport and magnetic properties. It is found that the ZnCo2O4/Si heterostructures exhibit a good rectifying behavior at four measured temperatures of 100K, 150K, 200K, and 290K. The energy band structure reveals that the electron is the mainly contributing factor to the current of the ZnCo2O4/Si heterostructures. The transport behaviors of these heterostructures can be qualitatively explained by diffusion or recombination in the space charge region at low voltages ranging from 0.16V to 0.3V, and the space-charge-limited current conduction mechanism plays a main role when the voltage is higher than 0.3V. The magnetic measurements of the ZnCo2O4/Si heterostructures indicate a strong ferromagnetic behavior at oxygen pressures ranging from 1.333Pa to 6.665Pa. It is believed that this work would open perspectives for ZnCo2O4/Si heterostructure-based devices.", "Iron nitride films, including single phase films of \u03b1-FeN (expanded bcc Fe), \u03b3\u2032-Fe4N, \u03b5-Fe3\u2212xN (0\u2264x\u22641), and \u03b3\u2033-FeN, were sputtered onto AlN buffered glass substrates. It was found possible to control the phases in the films merely by changing the nitrogen partial pressure during deposition. The magnetization decreased with increased nitrogen concentration and dropped to zero when the N:Fe ratio was above 0.5. The experimental results, along with spin polarized band calculations, have been used to discuss and analyze the magnetic properties of iron nitrides. It has been demonstrated that in addition to influencing the lattice constant of the various iron nitrides, the nearest N atoms have a significant influence on the exchange splitting of the Fe atoms. Due to the hybridization of Fe-3d and N-2p states, the magnetic moment of Fe atoms decreases with an increase in the number of nearest neighbor nitrogen atoms.", "Transparent and conductive ZnO:Al and In2O3:Sn thin films with 0.3\u03bcm thickness have been prepared by sputtering and subsequently annealed at temperatures ranging from 250 to 450\u00b0C in N2, 5% H2/N2 and air atmospheres. These samples combine high transparency (>85%) in the visible range with high electrical conductivity (>103\u03a9\u22121cm\u22121) and plasmonic absorption in the near-infrared region, which is found sensitive to the heating temperature and environment. Such sensitivity has been related to oxidation state changes observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in the respective Zn\u2013O and In\u2013O bonds, since this modifies intrinsic doping by annihilation or creation of donor oxygen vacancies. The infrared plasmonic characteristics (plasma and damping energies) along with the ultraviolet absorption onset (band-gap energy) have been analyzed as a function of the carrier concentration and mobility determined by Hall-effect measurements. Assuming analogous non-parabolicity factors for the conduction band of both materials, the experimental results are consistent with lower permittivity values for ZnO:Al than for In2O3:Sn samples.", "One dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) of TiO2/SiO2 multilayer has been fabricated by sequential asymmetric bipolar pulsed dc magnetron sputtering of TiO2 and radio frequency magnetron sputtering of SiO2 to achieve wide omnidirectional photonic band in the visible region. The microstructure and optical response of the TiO2/SiO2 photonic crystal have been characterized by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and spectrophotometry respectively. The surface of the photonic crystal is very smooth having surface roughness of 2.6nm. Reflection and transmission spectra have been measured in the wavelength range 300 to 1000nm for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic waves. Wide high reflection photonic band gap (\u2206\u03bb=245nm) in the visible and near infrared regions (592\u2013837nm) at normal incidence has been achieved. The measured photonic band gap (PBG) is found well matching with the calculated photonic band gap of an infinite 1DPC. The experimentally observed omnidirectional photonic band 592\u2013668nm (\u2206\u03bb=76nm) in the visible region with band to mid-band ratio \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb=12% for reflectivity R>99% over the incident angle range of 0\u00b0\u201370\u00b0 is found almost matching with the calculated omnidirectional PBG. The omnidirectional reflection band is found much wider as compared to the values reported in literature so far in the visible region for TiO2/SiO2 periodic photonic crystal.", "The annealing effect on the properties of silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) thin films has been investigated. The present contribution aims to study the structural and optical properties of SiOxNy thin films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition in view of their application in the field of photovoltaics. Evolution of the surface morphology and increase of the optical band gap with the thermal treatment have been determined and discussed in view of the application of the film as an emitter layer in heterojunction solar cells.", "We report systematic investigations of thickness dependent magnetic properties of amorphous Co40Fe40B20 (x nm) single-layer films and effects of number of multilayers and thickness of spacer layer on the magnetic properties of multilayer structured [Co40Fe40B20 (y nm)/Ta (z nm)]n=1\u20133/Co40Fe40B20 (y nm) films prepared directly on thermally oxidized Si substrate using magnetron sputtering technique. All the as-deposited films at ambient temperature exhibit amorphous structure. For single-layer films, coercivity (HC) and field required for saturation (HS) increase gradually with increasing x from 10 to 30nm, but exhibit a rapid increase when x\u226567nm. This behaviour was attributed to the change in the magnetic domain structure from in-plane magnetization to stripe domains caused by the development of effective magnetic anisotropy instigated by stress accumulated during the deposition. High temperature thermomagnetization data show the Curie temperature of Co40Fe40B20 (20nm) film as 512K. On the other hand, the introduction of thin Ta spacer layers in multilayer films helps reducing HC and HS substantially, but magnitude of the reduction depends strongly on the values of n and z. The increase of n diminishes the development of effective magnetic anisotropy in CoFeB film. This is due to the reduction in the thickness of the ferromagnetic layers, which changes the magnetic domain structure, and the optimum value of z enhancing interlayer coupling between CoFeB layers. Hence, the magnetic properties of the multilayer thin films are improved. The observed results are elucidated on the basis of change in the magnetic domain structure with increasing film thickness in single-layer films, and with increasing number of multilayers and spacer layer thickness dependent interlayer coupling in multilayer structured thin films.", "To explore the effect of proton irradiation on ferromagnetic Ni\u2013Mn\u2013Ga alloy, Ni54.5Mn26.3Ga19.2 thin films with the seven-layer modulated (7M) martensite structure were prepared by magnetron sputtering and irradiated by protons with an energy of 3MeV. The influence of proton irradiation on the microstructural and magnetic properties was investigated and discussed in detail. It is found that although nanoscale amorphous zones could be introduced by proton irradiation, the crystalline structure of the irradiated films retained the 7M martensite structure according to X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy results. Moreover, the broad diffraction peak at 2\u03b8=42.0\u00b0 for the unirradiated films is split into two peaks at diffraction angles of about 41.5\u00b0 and 42.2\u00b0, and the peak at 47.2\u00b0 disappeared for the irradiated films. Regarding the magnetic properties, the irradiation-induced nanoscale amorphous defects may hinder the movement of magnetic domain walls, causing increases in the coercivity (Hc) and remanence (Mr). In addition, irradiation-enhanced thermal ordering will play a dominant role in improving the ordering of incompletely annealed films, ultimately resulting in slight increases in saturation magnetization (Ms) and the Curie temperature (Tc).", "In this study, amorphous silicon carbonitride (SiCxNy) films were fabricated by radio frequency (RF) chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) using a single silazane precursor and a low power density (0.15W/cm3) for better compositional control. The effects of the precursor chemical structure (C/Si ratio, CSiN structure, and vinyl groups) and deposition temperature (Ts) on the chemical structure and optical properties of SiCxNy films were examined using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Specifically, two new single precursors; namely, n-methyl-aza-2,2,4-trimethylsilacyclopentane (MTSCP) and 1,3-divinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-disilazane (DVTMDS) were studied and compared. SiCxNy films deposited using MTSCP involving SiC3N rings formed SiN and Si(CH2)3 crosslinked structures at Ts\u2264100\u00b0C, and were then changed to predominantly SiCH2NSi crosslinked structures at Ts>300\u00b0C, leading to a wide range of optical band gap from 5.2 to 3.7eV. Compared to DVTMDS-deposited SiCxNy films, their relatively higher percentage of SiCN structure accounted for the lower optical band gap and reduced transmission. DVTMDS with di-vinyl groups readily formed a Si(CH2)2 bridge in SiCxNy films Ts\u2264200\u00b0C, resulting in excellent optical transmittance. The transmittance in the visible wavelengths of 400\u00b0C-deposited SiCxNy film using DVTMDS still showed 85%. Also, tunable refractive index between 1.44 and 2.10 were obtained for SiCxNy films deposited at Ts\u2264400\u00b0C.", "This work reports the correlations between electric and compositional properties of thin CdS films deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), which underwent pressures from 2.66 to 10.66 Pa using argon as inert gas. The films were deposited on substrates of glassy carbon and SiO2 and characterized by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, as well as van der Pauw and Hall measurements. Excess of cadmium in the deposited films at the lower pressures was observed, presumably from the CdS target, which resulted from the self-sputtering effect during PLD. Electrical characterization showed N-type behavior and resistivity decreasing proportional to the excess of cadmium in the films. The measured band gap after the deposition did not change from the initial 2.42 eV. Resistivity, charge carrier concentration and mobility ranged between (10\u22121\u2013104) \u03a9\u22c5cm, (1019\u20131013) cm\u22123 and (2\u201312) cm2\u22c5V\u22121\u22c5s\u22121, respectively. These results confirm the relevance of point defects and oxygen in the electrical properties of CdS indicating the possibility of controlling electrical response from deposition pressure.", "We report on picosecond ultrasonic measurements obtained on aluminum and platinum nanostructures with variable dot size and lateral periodicity which realized a 2D phononic crystal. Performing investigations at different resolution scales, we have identified individual modes of vibration depending on the dot size, and mode of vibration strongly correlated with the bi-dimensional organization. The platinum dots sputtered on an aluminum layer have shown a behavior of isolated oscillators without any coupling between neighbor elements in this phononic crystal. The frequency of such normal modes, extracted from time resolved measurements are in good agreement with 3D finite element simulations. In contrast, with aluminum dot systems where the coupling is more efficient we observe a complex spectrum of vibrational modes related to the band structure induced by the bi-dimensional patterning.", "Escherichia coli K12 cells suspended in apple cider were treated by manothermosonication (MTS, 400kPa/59\u00b0C), thermosonication (TS, 100kPa/59\u00b0C), and manosonication (MS, 400kPa/55\u00b0C) for up to 4min. A 5-log reduction was achieved in 1.4min by MTS, 3.8min by TS, and 2.5min by MS. The inactivation curves of the E. coli exhibited a fast initial reduction followed by a slow inactivation section. The Weibull, log\u2013logistic, and biphasic linear models showed a good fit of the inactivation data. Quality analyses were conducted with raw apple cider (control), thermally-pasteurized (TP), and MTS-, TS-, and MS-treated cider samples over a 3-week period at refrigeration temperature. Titratable acidity and pH did not differ among any of the samples. During storage, the turbidity value of the control was the highest, followed by TP, TS, MTS and MS. All color parameters of the TP sample were significantly different from those receiving the other treatments. The control and sonicated samples showed similar color parameters during storage. In total, 97 aroma compounds were identified in the control, TS-, MS-, and MTS-treated cider samples, while 95 aroma compounds were found in the TP at Week 0. Among all the aroma compounds, 9 key ones were identified in all samples, including ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, butyl acetate, 1-butanol, ethyl hexanoate, 1-hexanol, butanoic acid, \u03b2-damascenone, hexanoic acid, and octanoic acid. The profiles of the key aroma compounds in all sonicated samples were more similar to the control than the TP sample at Weeks 0 and 3.", "The deposition process of carbon coating by filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA) system was studied for the development of a high-density magnetic disk with an ultra-thin overcoat of about 2nm thickness. A FCVA system was installed on disk production equipment for the deposition of carbon thin coating on the disk sample. The FCVA method, processed at a low pressure of 10\u22124Pa, using no reactant gas, had some advantages over the plasma CVD method in deposition of the hard carbon thin coating on an electrically floated substrate. The carbon coating of less than 3nm in thickness was examined for the various properties with respect to the coating requirements for magnetic recording media. The properties of this ultra-thin coating were the same as those of a relatively thick tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) film. Moreover, the injection of the energetic ions from the arc source formed a mixture layer on the surface of the magnetic film. Several effective measures were proposed to avoid the deterioration of the magnetic properties.", "NixFe100\u2212x films with a thickness of about 200nm were deposited on SiO2/Si(100) substrates at room temperature by DC magnetron co-sputtering using both Fe and Ni80Fe20 targets. Compositional, structural, electrical and magnetic properties of the films were investigated. Ni76Fe24, Ni65Fe35, Ni60Fe40, Ni55Fe45, Ni49Fe51 films are obtained by increasing the sputtering power of the Fe target. All the films have a fcc structure. Ni76Fe24, Ni65Fe35, Ni60Fe40 and Ni55Fe45 films grow with crystalline orientations of [111] and [220] in the direction of the film growth while the Ni49Fe51 film has the [111] texture structure in the direction of the film growth. The lattice constant of the film increases linearly with increasing Fe content. All of the films grow with thin columnar grains and have void networks in the grain boundaries. The grain size does not change markedly with the composition of the film. The resistivity of the film increases with increasing Fe content and is one order of magnitude larger than that of the bulk. For all the films the magnetic hysteresis loop shows a hard magnetization. The Ni76Fe24 film has the lowest saturation magnetization of 6.75\u00d710\u22122T and the lowest saturation field of 8.36\u00d7104A/m while the Ni49Fe51 film has a largest saturation magnetization of 9.25\u00d710\u22122T and the largest saturation field of 1.43\u00d7105A/m.", "This paper presents structural, magnetization and transport properties measurements carried out on as-deposited Co (400\u00c5) thin film as well as samples annealed in the temperature range 100\u2013500\u00b0C in steps of 100\u00b0C for 1h. The samples used in this work were deposited on float glass substrates using ion beam sputtering technique. The magnetization measurements carried out using MOKE technique, clearly indicates that as-deposited as well as annealed samples up to 500\u00b0C show well saturation magnetization with applied magnetic field. The as-deposited sample shows coercivity value ( H c ) of 26Oe, and it is increased to 94Oe for 500\u00b0C-annealed sample. A minimum coercivity value of 15Oe is obtained for 200\u00b0C annealed sample. The XRD measurements of as deposited films show microcrystalline nature of Co film, which becomes crystalline with increase in annealing temperature. The corresponding resistivity measurements show gradual decrease in resistivity. AFM technique was employed to study the surface morphology of as deposited film as well as annealed thin films. Observed magnetization, and resistivity behaviour is mainly attributed to the (i) change in crystal structure (ii) increase in grain size and (iii) stress relaxation due to the annealing treatment.", "GaP1\u2212xNx thin films were deposited on glass substrates by RF sputtering employing a nitrogen\u2013argon atmosphere in a partial pressure of 2\u00d710\u22122Torr. We varied the growth temperature in the range 420\u2013520\u00b0C. The film's optical properties were studied by transmittance and absorbance spectroscopy. Characterization by scanning electron microscopy in cross-sectional view, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray diffraction was performed to determinate the film thickness, surface morphology, and crystal structure, respectively. Raman spectroscopy was employed to analyze the structural properties of samples. The GaP1\u2212xNx films presented a cubic polycrystalline structure with a preferential orientation along the [111] direction. By varying the growth conditions we were able to change the band gap energy between 1.35 and 1.98eV.", "The MgxZn1\u2212xO films were prepared in different Ar\u2013O2 mixture ambience by magnetron sputtering. According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results, it was found that the Mg contents in the films varied with the different ratios of O2/O2+Ar, and the crystal quality of the films improved with the increasing of Mg contents. Meanwhile, the ultraviolet and visible (UV\u2013vis) absorption spectroscopy indicated that the band gap of the films also increased. Moreover, it could be seen that the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was different from that of undoped Zinc oxide (ZnO) films or the results in other reports on the MgxZn1\u2212xO films: there was no blueshift effect happening for the near-band-edge (NBE) emission in MgxZn1\u2212xO films with different Mg contents.", "ZnO films both undoped and doped with Fe were deposited on Si substrates using rf-magnetron sputtering. The results showed that fractal features were clearly exhibited in the ZnO film doped with Fe. It is proposed that the fractal aggregates were the result of cluster diffusion-limited aggregation (CDLA) of magnetic particles on the surface of the film. The fractal dimension of a main branch (D=1.47) was smaller than that expected by the CDLA model (D=1.72). In this paper the growth mechanism of the observed fractal aggregates is discussed in terms of the magnetism of FeO, nanoparticle aggregation and surface tension changes.", "Hydrogenated amorphous carbon nitride (a-CNx:H) films were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in CH4\u2013NH3 system. The chemical composition and bonding configuration were investigated by XPS and FTIR. The results indicated that both sp2CN and sp3CN bonds generally increased with the increase of the nitrogen concentration, and the N atoms bonded to C atoms through CN, CN and CN bonds. Remarkably, for FTIR spectra, two peaks (2125 and 2200cm\u22121) were obviously observed, corresponding to CN bond which was found to predominantly exist in the isonitrile structure. As more nitrogen atoms were incorporated, the optical band gap was found to vary from 1.8 to 2.5eV. Finally, the conduction mechanisms were discussed at low and high temperature, respectively.", "By making use of the dc magnetron sputtering system, the Au/FePt bilayers have been prepared on glass substrates and anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes with an average pore diameter of around 200nm. In both cases, the FePt films can be converted into the magnetically hard phase, namely L10 phase, after a heat treatment above 500\u00b0C for 1h. A nanoparticle-like structure can be observed in the 15-nm-thick FePt film on the AAO membrane. The experimental observations of the structure and the magnetism of the FePt films on the AAO membranes are firstly established.", "Nickel oxide thin films of various thicknesses were grown on glass substrates by dc reactive magnetron sputtering technique in a pure oxygen atmosphere with sputtering power of 150 W and substrate temperature of 523 K. Crystalline properties of NiO films as a function of film thickness were investigated using X-ray diffraction. XRD analysis revealed that (200) is the preferred orientation and the orientation of the films changed from (200) to (220) at film thickness of 350 nm. The maximum optical transmittance of 60% and band gap of 3.82 eV was observed at the film thickness of 350 nm. The lowest electrical resistivity of 5.1 \u03a9 cm was observed at a film thickness of 350 nm, thereafter resistivity increases with film thickness.", "Ga2O3 thin films have been deposited on sapphire (0001) substrates at different substrate temperatures by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. Trimethylgallium and oxygen were used as precursors for gallium and oxygen, respectively. Structural and optical properties of the films have been investigated. X-ray diffraction and high resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements identified an epitaxial relationship of \u03b2-Ga2O3 ( 2 \u00af 01)||Al2O3 (0001) with \u03b2-Ga2O3<010>||Al2O3< 1 1 \u00af 00> and \u03b2-Ga2O3<102>||Al2O3< 11 2 \u00af 0>. The average transmittance of the obtained films in the visible wavelength range was over 92.3% and the band gap was about 4.73\u20134.96 eV.", "Electron motion in magnetron discharges is complicated. In a first approximation, single particle motion can be considered in given electric and magnetic fields to estimate drifts. Based on magnetic and electric field measurements for discharges in an unbalanced magnetron with a strong magnet it is shown that, for the most energetic electrons, the \u2207B and curvature drift velocities can be comparable to or even larger than the commonly mentioned E \u00d7 B drift velocity. In the fluid approximation, the electron pressure gradient adds yet another drift component. Since all of those drifts are generally additive, the term \u201cE \u00d7 B drift\u201d can be generically used but should be understood to include other drifts. Strong velocity gradients and direction reversal can be found, which suggest velocity shear as a source of waves and instabilities, likely creating the density-fluctuation \u201cseeds\u201d for ionization zones seen in high power impulse magnetron sputtering.", "In order to find the potential applications of InSnO2 films for use as a transparent conducting oxide (TCO), the structural, electrical, and optical properties of InSnO2:Ti films were studied by changing Ti-doping concentration. InSnO2:Ti films were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering using an InSnO2 target containing 0.25\u20132.5 wt.% Ti under a fixed substrate temperature (300 \u00b0C), RF power (300 W), and argon (Ar) gas pressure (13 mbar). The thin film characteristics of the InSnO2:Ti were strongly influenced by the Ti-doping concentration. The optimum Ti-doping at 1.25 wt.% of InSnO2 was observed to improve the crystallinity the resistivity, the carrier mobility, and the band-gap energy of the films and to activate crystalline grain growth. However, higher Ti doping concentrations of 2.5 wt.% may induce TiO2 particle formation on the deposited InSnO2 film delaying InSnO2 grain growth and degrading other properties.", "The structure, magnetic and magnetotransport properties of YBaCo4O7+\u03b4 thin films deposited by high oxygen-pressure dc magnetron sputtering on (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates have been studied. The film growth was carried out at three different substrate temperatures (750 \u00b0C, 850 \u00b0C and 870 \u00b0C) in order to determine the influence of this parameter on the crystalline quality of the films deposited on SrTiO3 substrates. Within these limits, the growth quality, with respect to the preferential growth orientation, changed significantly improving notably with increasing substrate temperature. The enhanced intensity of (203), (220) and (110) reflections stemming from films grown at 850 \u00b0C suggests that the as-grown films are polycrystalline. In turn, the dependence of the resistivity on temperature shows a semiconducting-like behavior, without any distinguishable structure, in the temperature range measured (400\u2013120 K). The analysis of the experimental data shows that the transport mechanism in the films is well described by using the Mott variable range hopping (VRH) conduction model. From the fitting procedure, a temperature scale T\u2217\u223c107 K is obtained which ended up being similar to that found in other transition metal oxides. The fact that the conductivity of oxygen-rich YBaCo4O7+\u03b4 samples features a VRH nature implies itinerant electron states with the apparent insulating behavior due to magnetic frustration. Interestingly, the YBaCo4O7+\u03b4 thin films show a positive magnetoresistance over the studied temperature range without evidence for transition to negative values as observed in ferromagnetic cobaltites. The origin of the positive magnetoresistance effect in the studied samples is difficult to explain by the known magnetoresistance models as the samples don't show evident magnetic transition in the entire temperature region from low temperature to room temperature. Nevertheless, the main features of the positive magnetoresistance seem to be explained by Zeeman splitting of the localized states that suppresses the spin dependent hopping paths in the presence of on-site Coulomb repulsion.", "In the tandem Cu(In1\u2212xGax)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cell fabrication, Indium tin oxide thin film (ITO) is a promising material as back contacts of the top cell. ITO thin films were deposited by radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering in pure argon atmosphere at a working pressure of 9 \u00d7 10\u22124 Torr with substrate temperature (Tsub) of 300 \u00b0C. The sheet resistance of as-deposited 200 nm-thick ITO thin films was about 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm. The ITO thin films were subsequently annealed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at a temperature range between 400 and 550 \u00b0C for application of the high-temperature CuGaSe2 (CGS) deposition process. After the annealing processes of ITO thin films, we have examined the optical and electrical properties as transparent conducting oxide (TCO) back contacts. CGS thin films were prepared for the top cell in a tandem solar cell structure with wide bandgap of above 1.6 eV as high open circuit voltage photovoltaic devices. The optical and electrical properties of CGS thin film solar cells with ITO back contacts were investigated as compared with that of metallic Mo back contacts. Also, the CGS thin film solar cells were fabricated using ITO and MO back contacts with a conversion efficiency of 5 and 8.2%, respectively.", "We have measured the band offsets of sputtered ZrSiO4 on bulk ZnO wafers using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and obtained the bandgaps of these two materials using reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy. The valence band offset was determined to be \u22120.60 eV \u00b1 0.04 eV for ZrSiO4 on ZnO, while the respective bandgaps were 3.22 eV for ZnO and 5.9 eV for ZrSiO4. The conduction band offset for ZrSiO4/ZnO was then determined to be 3.28 eV. The ZrSiO4/ZnO system has a staggered, type II alignment. This means that while ZrSiO4 may be useful for surface passivation applications on ZnO, it is not suitable for thin film transistors where a positive valence band offset is needed.", "Amorphous aluminum oxide (a-Al2O3, alumina) can be widely used for ceramic coatings, gate oxide for microelectronics and waveguiding component of integrated optical elements. Moreover, it is a candidate for masks and molds for the preparation of new generation nanoscale devices. Among different technological procedures, cathode sputtering is one of the most effective techniques to deposit amorphous materials which could not be vitrified by an ordinary melting method. Here, the structural and optical properties of Direct Current (DC) magnetron and Radio Frequency (RF) sputtered alumina layers have been revealed regarding to the preparation method. It is shown that the optical absorption and the refractive index of the RF sputtered alumina enable the films to be used as high quality waveguiding material. The oxygen incorporation from the plasma with higher oxygen content results in a bandgap shift to the lower values. Contrarily, reactive DC magnetron sputtering process led to only partly oxidized film growth exhibiting higher absorption.", "Single crystalline thin films of Sm0.50Sr0.50MnO3 (SSMO) (thickness \u223c200 nm) were prepared on LSAT (100) single crystal substrates by dc magnetron sputtering. The X-ray diffraction \u03b8\u20122\u03b8 and \u03c9-2\u03b8 scan reveals that these films (i) have very good crystallinity, (ii) are oriented along out-of-plane c-direction, and (iii) are under small tensile strain. Temperature and magnetic field dependent electrical transport of these films shows (i) sharp paramagnetic insulator (PMI) to ferromagnetic metal (FMM) transition, (ii) large enhancement in TIM when subjected to magnetic field, (iii) hysteretic variation in resistivity with magnetic field, and (iv) huge occurrence of magnetoresistance near PMI-FMM transition. The magnetic state in the FMM (T TC) regime resembles cluster glass, which is formed by the presence of charge ordered-antiferromagnetic clusters in the ferromagnetic matrix. The results shown in the present study could be regarded as the consequence of strong nature of phase separation in these films due to competing FMM and AFM-COI phases in these films which is known to be the generic feature of low bandwidth manganites.", "The undoped and Mg-doped ZnO ceramics have been successfully synthesized using the conventional solid state sintering method. The doping effect of MgO content on the structural properties of ZnO/MgO composites has been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD patterns reveal that all the samples are polycrystalline and have a prominent hexagonal crystalline structure with (002) and (101) as preferred growth directions. The formation of the hexagonal ZnMgO alloy phase and the segregation of MgO-cubic phase took place for an MgO composition x\u226520wt%. This finding is in good agreement with the Raman spectroscopy measurements which prove the existence of multiple-order Raman peaks originating from ZnO-like and MgO phonons. The band gap energy and the carrier concentration of ZnO pellets were found to be dependent upon the Mg doping whose values vary from 3.287 to 3.827eV and from 1.6\u00d71017 to 5.2\u00d71020 cm\u22123, respectively.", "The drive to reduce lubrication in sheet metal forming (SMF) operations has increased the interest to study the contact between polished tool materials sliding over relatively rough sheet surfaces. Commonly, transfer of sheet material to the tool surface occurs by adhesive wear. In the present work, a study of wear showed that the origination of the damage was complex and several simultaneous wear mechanisms were operative, even though friction did not change remarkably. A low strength carbon steel sheet was tested under dry sliding conditions against conventionally ingot cast and powder metallurgy cold work tool steels. The sheet was sputtered with a thin gold layer, which acted as a marker helping to reveal details of the wear mechanisms. Initial sliding was characterized by local adhesive wear with transfer of sheet material, predominantly, to the metallic matrix of the tool. Seemingly, the carbides have less adhesion to the sheet material than the steel matrix. Subsequently, materials transfer resulted in gradual coverage of carbides with formation of a semi-continuous thin layer of sheet material on the tools surface. Further sliding led to initiation of local microscratching of the sheet surface due to formation of lumps of sheet material adhered to the tool. Comparison of the two different tool steels revealed that the amount of adhered sheet material depended on amount, size and distribution of carbides and was higher for the ingot cast steel with coarser carbide phase. The advantage of the powder metallurgy steel was associated to removal of adhered material from the tool due to a higher amount and a more homogeneous distribution of finer carbides.", "Solid solution formation between the ferroelectric hexagonal compound YMnO3 and the semiconducting perovskite compound CaMnO3 has been studied in the Y-rich region of the pseudobinary system. The materials were prepared by reaction of the corresponding oxides and the calcium carbonate for obtaining the corresponding phases and subsequent sintering of the pressed powders in the 1400\u20131525 \u00b0C-temperature range. Their ceramic characteristics were established. Samples with relative density >98% Dth were obtained. The hexagonal symmetry of the pure yttrium manganite changes to an orthorhombic one, isostructural with that of the GdMnO3 compound, for \u223c32 mol % CaMnO3. The incorporation of the Ca cation causes an increasing in the compactness of the lattice cell, promoting a rise in the apparent density, despite of the smaller atomic weight of the Ca cation against that of the Y one, until the transition to the orthorhombic lattice occurs. Subsequent increase in the Ca amount lead to a decrease in the theoretical density.The electrical conductivity of the solid solutions increases strongly from 100 to the 90/10 Y/Ca composition, and more moderately for higher Ca amounts. Conductivity values as high as 10\u22122 S \u00b7 cm\u22121 were measured on the denser samples. The activation energy for conduction suffers a corresponding decrease when the Ca amount is increased.", "Electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were measured in a temperature range of 320\u20131073 K for sintered samples of Bi2Sr2Ca1 \u2212 xYxCu2Oy (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0). It has been found that the conduction behavior changes from n-type metallic to p-type semiconducting with increasing yttrium concentration. The power factors were in a range of 1.7\u20133.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 Wm\u22121 K\u22122 for the sample with x = 0.8, being maximized by the optimization of the yttrium concentration. The thermal conductivity for the sample with x = 0.8 was 0.73 Wm\u22121 K\u22121 at 310 K, and decreased with increasing temperature. The values of thermoelectric figure of merit were estimated to be in a range of 3.4\u20134.8 \u00d7 10\u22125 K\u22121 at temperatures of 320\u2013673 K for the sample with x = 0.8.", "The magnetic and electrical properties of the cobalt ferrite/metal composite thin films, prepared by reactive sputtering, were studied as a function of substrate temperature. With increasing substrate temperature, the saturation magnetization of the thin films increased owing to precipitation of the Co0.67Fe0.33 phase. Also, the electrical resistivity of the thin films decreased. From Hall experiments, the decrease of electrical resistivity of the composite thin films was mainly attributed to the increase of electron concentration. The Seebeck coefficient measurement shows that the electrical conduction mechanism of the thin films containing 37.8 and 33.7 at % Co changes from p-type to n-type and that of the thin films containing 28.5 at % Co remains n-type with increasing substrate temperature. This might be attributed to the change in composition of the cobalt ferrite matrix to Fe-excess with precipitation of Co-rich Fe alloy.", "The microstructure and properties of Ba3Co2Fe24O41 hexagonal ferrite sintered at relatively low temperature by the gel self-propagating method are investigated. XRD analysis and SEM pictures indicate that the formation and densification of Ba3Co2Fe24O41 hexaferrites can be achieved at relatively low temperature. Results from frequency spectra show higher initial permeability, stable cutoff frequencies and quality factor values for the sintered ferrites. The densification and microstructure are correlated to the magnetic properties. The electrical properties, such as resistivity and frequency dependence of dielectric constant, and relative mechanisms involved in generating these effects are discussed in this paper.", "Integrated electroceramic thin-film devices on semiconducting or insulating substrate materials offer a wide variety of attractive attributes, including high capacitance density, nonvolatile memory, sensor/actuator ability, and other unique electrical, electromechanical, magnetic and optical functions. Thus the ability to pattern such electroceramic thin films is a critical technology for future device realization. Patterned oxide thin-film devices are typically formed by uniform film deposition followed by somewhat complicated post-deposition ion-beam or chemical etching in a controlled environment i.e., a subtractive method. We review here an upset technology, a different way of patterning, by an additive approach, which allows for the selective deposition of electroceramic thin layers without such post-deposition etching. In this method, substrate surfaces are selectively functionalized with hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers to modify the adhesion of subsequently deposited solution-derived electroceramics. The selective functionalization is achieved through microcontact printing (\u03bc-CP) of self-assembled monolayers of the chemical octadecyltrichlorosilane on substrates of current technical interest. Subsequent sol-gel deposition of ceramic oxides on these functionalized substrates, followed by lift-off from the monolayer, yields high quality, patterned oxide thin layers only on the unfunctionalized regions. A variety of micron-scale dielectric oxide devices have been fabricated by this method, with lateral resolution as fine as 0.5 \u03bcm. In this paper, we review the monolayer patterning and electrical behavior of several patterned electroceramic thin films, including Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 [PZT], LiNbO3, and Ta2O5. A multilevel example is also given which combines selective MOCVD deposition of metal electrodes and sol-gel patterned PZT for Pt//PZT//Pt//Si(100) ferroelectric memory cells.", "A systematic study was performed on the structural and electrical properties of cerium dioxide thin films grown on Si substrate with various deposition temperatures by RF magnetron sputtering. The films grown at 200\u00b0C are partly amorphous whereas those grown above 250\u00b0C are polycrystalline. An amorphous layer of SiO2 forms at the interface between the cerium dioxide film and the Si substrate. Cerium dioxide film grown at higher temperatures up to 500\u00b0C sustains more leakage current on the basis of current-voltage measurements. The electrical conduction of the films is well fitted by a power-law relation, which is explained as space-charge-limited current conduction with exponential distributed traps in the band gap. The variations of dielectric constant, flatband voltage, fixed oxide charge and interface-trapped charge with deposition temperature were studied by making capacitance-voltage measurements on an Al/CeO2/Si structure. The variations of electrical properties with temperature are strongly correlated with the formation of an amorphous SiO2 layer.", "We describe the preparation and the properties of Fe-filled multi-walled carbon nanotubes on Co-coated oxidized silicon substrates. The material was grown by pyrolysis of ferrocene, using a chemical vapor deposition process. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy studies indicate that the material consists of filled and aligned MWNTs. They have outer diameters of 40\u2013100 nm and diameters of the metal core of 20\u201340 nm. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of individual tubes reveals that their filling consists of pure Fe. Alternating gradient magnetometry investigations demonstrate the ferromagnetic behavior of the filled tubes. We observe unique magnetic properties differing from those of bulk Fe.", "The optoelectronic properties of undoped \u03bcc-Si : H have been investigated, with emphasis on the states close to the edges of the band gap. The usefulness of the constant photocurrent method (CPM) for the determination of the absorption coefficient, \u03b1(E), is critically described. Combined with carefully evaluated photothermal deflection spectroscopy data, CPM spectra yield valuable information on the transport and dynamics of photo-generated carriers. By comparing photoluminescence and Raman spectra on high-quality samples prepared by plasma-enhanced and hot-wire chemical vapor deposition, with different silane concentrations in the gas stream, a correlation between the microstructure and photoluminescence energy is obtained. It is proposed that the density of band tail states is reduced with increasing silane concentration, leading to an increase in the photoluminescence energy and in the open-circuit voltages of solar cells.", "The conditions of Bi2Ti4O11 formation are studied. It is shown that the process is diffusion-controlled and depends significantly on the heating rate. The optimal conditions for producing Bi2Ti4O11 ceramics are determined. Cold pressing of Bi2Ti4O11 ceramic powder at high pressures is shown to influence the unit-cell parameters and volume, positional parameters of Bi and Ti, and bond distances in the ferroelectric ceramics produced by subsequent sintering. The ferroelectric transition temperature decreases steadily with increasing densification pressure.", "CoNiFe-based amorphous films were magnetron-sputtered to investigate their structural and magnetic properties, including annealing-induced effects and interfacial influence from additional layers of Ta and Cu. The amorphous structure was confirmed by diffraction experiments. The magnetic measurements showed a well-defined uniaxial anisotropy in plane, arising possibly from atom oblique incidence effects competing with the stray field of the magnetron. The anisotropy could be influenced by using a Ta buffer layer, though the interfacial reaction gives rise to a dead layer. A coercive force Hc of 1\u20132 Oe and a magnetization of 680 emu/cm3 were measured at room temperature; properties which show promise for application in magnetotunneling junction devices. Thermal analyses showed a two-stage crystallization behavior, which started at 400\u00b0C and ended at about 600\u00b0C. The Curie temperature of the amorphous phase was estimated to be about 440\u00b0C.", "Vertically aligned undoped ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) have been fabricated on silicon (111) substrates by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The structural studies illustrate a hexagonal wurtzite structure of the ZnO NRAs with compressive stress. Raman analysis of the E2high phonon mode corroborates the partial relaxation of stress in NRAs by the post growth treatment under oxygen and vacuum atmospheres. The anomalous Raman modes have been attributed to the local vibrations and it corresponds to the silent modes of wurtzite ZnO. The appearance of forbidden modes illustrates the breakdown of the Raman selection rules. The role of point defects on the ferromagnetic behaviour of NRAs was analyzed by optical transitions and correlated with the magnetic properties. Post growth treatment of NRAs under oxygen and vacuum atmospheres significantly suppresses the point defects owing to the enhancement of the crystalline quality. The temperature dependent zero-field cooled and field cooled magnetizations reveal the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism below 7 K. However, the ferromagnetism is dominant and stable between 7 K and room temperature. The decrease of ferromagnetism in NRAs is directly associated with the compensation of point defects such as zinc and oxygen vacancies as substantiated by the radiative transition between shallow donor and acceptor energy levels. These results confirm that point defects play an important role in enhancing the room temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO NRAs.", "The present study revealed a surprising valence transformation of copper (Cu) in the sintering process of mixtures of copper chloride dihydrate (CuCl2\u00b72H2O) with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) in ambient atmosphere. Such a transformation in Cu valence states can be modulated by changing the initial molar ratio (IMR) of CuCl2\u00b72H2O to \u03b2-CD in the mixtures. Firstly, as the value of IMR decreased, the content of cuprous chloride (CuCl) decreased, while the content of cupric oxide (CuO) increased gradually. That is to say, there is an unambiguous IMR-dependence of the contents of CuCl and CuO formed. However, such a controllable valence transformation from Cu(II) to Cu(I) to Cu(II) did not happen in nitrogen atmosphere. Secondly, the in situ composite of CuCl and CuO produced a highly ordered structure of self-assembled nanowires, intertwined, with a diameter of 30 to 50 nm. Furthermore, electronic structural analysis provided direct evidence that the Cu\u2013Cl and Cu\u2013O bonds in this composite material were simultaneously impaired by self-assembled growth. Finally, we noticed that the photoluminescence property of CuCl was regulated through the formation of composites with CuO. In addition, this in situ composite synthesis technique was used to modify the magnetic property of CuO. Furthermore, the anomalous ferromagnetic behaviour of the CuO nanocrystal was observed and explained. In short, this work not only demonstrates a flexible and easily controllable valence transformation of Cu, but also provides a novel approach for constructing inorganic nanocomposite materials. We believe that the implications of these findings are important and make significant contributions to the development of inorganic chemistry and material science.", "The emergence of micro sampling techniques holds great potential to improve pharmacokinetic data quality, reduce animal usage, and save costs in safety assessment studies. The analysis of these samples presents new challenges for bioanalytical scientists, both in terms of sample processing and analytical sensitivity. The use of two dimensional LC/MS with, at-column-dilution for the direct analysis of highly organic extracts prepared from biological fluids such as dried blood spots and plasma is demonstrated. This technique negated the need to dry down and reconstitute, or dilute samples with water/aqueous buffer solutions, prior to injection onto a reversed-phase LC system. A mixture of model drugs, including bromhexine, triprolidine, enrofloxacin, and procaine were used to test the feasibility of the method. Finally an LC/MS assay for the probe pharmaceutical rosuvastatin was developed from dried blood spots and protein-precipitated plasma. The assays showed acceptable recovery, accuracy and precision according to US FDA guidelines. The resulting analytical method showed an increase in assay sensitivity of up to forty fold as compared to conventional methods by maximizing the amount loaded onto the system and the MS response for the probe pharmaceutical rosuvastatin from small volume samples.", "A novel method for the determination of 55 multi-class veterinary drug residues in different muscle tissues (porcine, bovine and ovine animals) by modified QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) combined with high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) is described. The veterinary drugs focused on here belong to several families, such as macrolides, quinolones, sulfonamides, benzimidazoles, and \u03b2-agonists (unbound). The samples were first extracted with 5% acetic acid in acetonitrile, followed by cleanup with QuEChERS and sequential analysis by HPLC-MS/MS technique. It was found that the majority of analytes (89.1%) can achieve the mean recoveries between 70% and 120% in the examined matrices. The repeatability and reproducibility are lower than 20% for 94.1% and 90.3% of total analytes in these matrices, respectively. 86.7% of the compounds could have \u03b32 of 0.99 or above. The range of limits of quantification (LOQ) for these compounds in porcine, bovine and ovine is 0.1 to 18.4 \u03bcg kg\u22121, 0.1 to 20.0 \u03bcg kg\u22121, and 0.1 to 18.4 \u03bcg kg\u22121, respectively. Finally, the method was applied to real samples, and ofloxacin was found in one bovine sample at 2.5 \u03bcg kg\u22121. The method is sensitive, accurate, quick and simple, and suitable for the routine analysis of meat products.", "Electrically driven energy transfer between the surface defect states of ZnO quadrilateral microwires (MWs) and localized surface plasmon polaritons has been realized by means of introducing Au nanoparticles (NPs). An electroluminescence device with green emission using ZnO quadrilateral MWs, was fabricated. Once the Au NPs are sputtered on the surfaces of the ZnO MWs, the electroluminescence of the ZnO MWs will shift from green to red. Meanwhile, dual emissions were observed by means of sputtering Au NPs on a single ZnO MW periodically. Due to the Au NPs, electrically driven plasmon mediated energy transfer can achieve the modulation of amplifying, or quenching the surface defect emission. The relevant dynamic process of the surface plasmon mode mediated energy transfer was investigated. This new energy transfer method potentially offers an approach of modification and recombination of the surface defect state excitations of wide bandgap semiconductor materials.", "High Curie temperature ferromagnetism has been realized in atomically thin MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets. The ultrathin nanosheet samples were prepared via a novel, simple and efficient chemical vapor deposition method; different kinds of transition metal disulfides (MoS2 and WS2) could be obtained by sulphuring the corresponding cation sources (MoO3 and WCl6). Through related morphological and structural characterization, we confirm that large-area, uniform, few-layer MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets were successfully synthesized by this method. Both nanosheet samples exhibit distinct ferromagnetic behavior. By careful measurement and fitting of the magnetization of MoS2 and WS2 samples at different temperatures, we deconstruct the magnetization into its diamagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions. The ferromagnetic contributions persist until 865 K for MoS2 and 820 K for WS2. We attribute the observed ferromagnetic properties to the defects and dislocations produced during the growth process, as well as the presence of edge spins at the edge of the nanosheets.", "Tin-doped \u03b2-Ga2O3 (\u03b2-Ga2O3:Sn) films doped with different tin concentrations were deposited on MgO (110) substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at 700 \u00b0C. The effect of doping on the structural, electrical and optical properties of the films was investigated. The 10% Sn-doped film exhibited the best electrical conductivity properties with the lowest resistivity about 5.21 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03a9 cm, which is over ten orders of magnitude lower than the un-doped film. Micro-structural analysis revealed that the film with 10% Sn content had a clear in-plane relationship of \u03b2-Ga2O3 (100) \u2016 MgO (110) with \u03b2-Ga2O3 (01) \u2016 MgO (111). The average transmittance of the samples in the visible range exceeded 87% and the optical band gap of the films varied from 4.12 to 4.80 eV.", "The use of relatively low purity zinc nitrate for electrochemical deposition of compact ZnO films is attractive for large scale production because of the cost saving potential. ZnO films were grown on SnO2:F and magnetron sputtered ZnO:Al templates using a three electrode potentiostatic system in galvanic mode. The electrolyte consisted of a 0.1 M zinc nitrate solution (either 99.998% or 99% purity) and 1 mM aluminium nitrate for extrinsic doping, when required. Moderate deposition rates of up to 0.9 nm s\u22121 were achieved on ZnO:Al templates with lower rates of up to 0.5 nm s\u22121 on SnO2:F templates. Observation of SEM images of the films revealed a wall-like morphology whose lateral thickness (parallel to the substrate) reduced as aluminium was added to the system either in the electrolyte or from the substrate. However, pre-deposition activation of the template by applying a negative voltage (approximately \u22122 V) allowed the growth of compact films even for the low purity electrolyte. The optical band gap energy of intrinsically doped films was lower than that of the Al doped films. The composite electrical conductivity of all the films studied, as inferred from sheet resistance and Hall effect measurements of the ZnO/template stacks was much less than that of the uncoated templates. A strong E2 (high) mode at around 437 cm\u22121 was visible in the Raman spectra for most films confirming the formation of ZnO. However, both the Raman modes and XRD reflections associated with wurtzite ZnO diminished for the Al doped films indicating a high level of mainly oxygen related defects. Based on these data, further studies are underway to improve the doping efficiency of aluminium, the crystalline structure and thus the conductivity of such films.", "Lead chalcogenides are dominant thermoelectric materials in the medium-temperature range due to their highly favorable electronic band structures and low thermal conductivities. An important system is the PbTe\u2013PbS pseudo-binary, and its low thermal conductivity originates largely from the coexistence of both alloying and nanostructuring through phase-separation. To better understand the competition between the alloying and phase separation and its pronounced effects on the thermoelectric performance in PbTe\u2013PbS, we systematically studied, via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations and theoretical calculations, the samples of Spark Plasma Sintered (SPSed) 3 at% Na-doped (PbTe)1\u2212x(PbS)x with x = 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 35%. The highest figure of merit, viz., ZT \u223c 2.3 was obtained at 923 K, when the PbS phase-fraction, x, was 20%, which corresponds to the lowest lattice thermal conductivity of the series. The consistently lower lattice thermal conductivities in the SPSed samples as compared with the corresponding ingots originates from the mesostructured nature of the former, which contributes significantly to their superior ZT. We also studied the onset of carrier concentration modulation at \u223c600 K, which leads to the observed saturation of electrical transport properties due to the diffusion and re-dissolution of excessive Na into the PbTe\u2013PbS matrix. This carrier concentration modulation is equally crucial to achieve very high power factors (up to 26.5 \u03bcW cm\u22121 K\u22122 at 623 K) and outstanding thermoelectric performances in SPSed PbTe\u2013PbS binaries.", "We report a simple, green, one-step solid-phase approach to synthesize well-dispersed single-crystal L10-FePt nanoparticles with coercivity of more than 20 kOe. In this method, only Fe and Pt metal precursors are used in the absence of an organic solvent and surfactant, and a NaCl particle media is used both as substrate for nanoparticle nucleation and growth, and an insulation medium preventing nanoparticle coalescence during high temperature sintering. The chemically ordered L10-FePt nanoparticles can be obtained at synthesis temperatures as low as 350 \u00b0C. The size of the FePt nanoparticles can be tailored from 7.2 nm to 15 nm and the coercivity at room temperature can be tuned from 3.15 kOe to 21.5 kOe depending on the synthesis temperatures. The elemental analysis shows a uniform distribution and 1\u2006:\u20061 atomic ratio of Fe/Pt. The evolution of particle formation, phase transition, ordering parameter, particle size, and magnetic properties have been measured and analyzed by TG-DTA, XRD, TEM and MPMS at different synthesis temperatures from 300 \u00b0C to 750 \u00b0C. The nanoparticles synthesized by this method can be applicable in fields such as magnetism and catalysis.", "As a rising star in two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted tremendous attention for their potential applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and photonics. Driven by the high standards of practical devices, alloying theory has been proposed for modulating the electronic structure of TMDs materials as well as their physical and chemical properties. To date, however, very limited alloy materials can be synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and a very limited band gap range can be achieved. Herein, for the first time, we report a one-step CVD strategy for the growth of ternary alloy Mo(1\u2212x)WxS2 monolayers (ML) on SiO2/Si substrates with controllable composition. Both Mo(1\u2212x)WxS2 and MoS2(1\u2212x)Se2x alloy materials with high crystallinity were synthesized in this study. Therefore, the bandgap photoluminescence (PL) can be broaden from 1.97 eV (for ML-WS2) to 1.55 eV (for ML-MoSe2). Furthermore, density functional theory calculations were performed to reveal the important role of alloying in tailoring the electronic structure of 2D materials.", "\u201cBand gap engineering\u201d in two-dimensional (2D) materials plays an important role in tailoring their physical and chemical properties. The tuning of the band gap is typically achieved by controlling the composition of the semiconductor alloys. However, large-area preparation of 2D alloys remains a major challenge. Here, we report the large-area synthesis of high-quality monolayered MoS2(1\u2212x)Se2x with a size coverage of hundreds of microns using a chemical vapor deposition method. The photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy results confirm the tunable band gap in MoS2(1\u2212x)Se2x, which is modulated by varying the Se content. Atomic-scale analysis was performed and the chemical composition was characterized using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. With the introduction of Se into monolayered MoS2, it leads to enhanced catalytic activity in an electrochemical reaction for hydrogen generation, compared to monolayered MoS2 and MoSe2. It is promising as a potential alternative to expensive noble metals.", "Graphene has attracted increasing interest due to its remarkable properties. However, the zero band gap of monolayered graphene limits it's further electronic and optoelectronic applications. Herein, we have synthesized monolayered silicon-doped graphene (SiG) with large surface area using a chemical vapor deposition method. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the silicon atoms are doped into graphene lattice at a doping level of 2.7\u20134.5 at%. Electrical measurements based on a field effect transistor indicate that the band gap of graphene has been opened via silicon doping without a clear degradation in carrier mobility, and the work function of SiG, deduced from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, was 0.13\u20130.25 eV larger than that of graphene. Moreover, when compared with the graphene/GaAs heterostructure, SiG/GaAs exhibits an enhanced performance. The performance of 3.4% silicon doped SiG/GaAs solar cell has been improved by 33.7% on average, which was attributed to the increased barrier height and improved interface quality. Our results suggest that silicon doping can effectively engineer the band gap of monolayered graphene and SiG has great potential in optoelectronic device applications.", "Herein, we report on a scalable synthesis of Au nanodot (Au-ND)/Bi2Te3 nanotube (BT-NT) nanocomposites by the bottom-up synthesis of hybrid raw materials and subsequent spark plasma sintering, and their thermoelectric properties were systematically compared with those of Au-doped Bi2Te3 compounds. The Au nanodots were included as seeds and co-crystallized in the crystal growth of BT-NTs, which were well-dispersed in the Bi2Te3 matrix as nanoinclusions (10\u201320 nm). The thermoelectric performance (ZT) of the Au-ND/BT-NT nanocomposite was found to be enhanced by \u223c67%, compared to pristine Bi2Te3 due to electron energy filtering and phonon scattering effects in the presence of embedded Au-NDs. The resulting compound showed an enhanced power factor (23.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 W m\u22121 K\u22122 @ 440 K, 27% improvement) and a reduced lattice thermal conductivity (0.47 W m\u22121 K\u22121 @ 440 K, 22% reduction). The peak ZT value of the present compound (0.95 @ 480 K) is larger than that of n-type single crystalline Bi2(Te,Se)3, which is one of the highest among the reported values for n-type Bi2Te3-based materials synthesized using a soft chemical route.", "25 nm carbon-coated microporous Co/CoO nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by integrating chemical de-alloying and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods. The NPs possess micropores of 0.8\u20131.5 nm and display a homogeneous carbon shell of about 4 nm in thickness with a low graphitization degree. The saturation magnetization (MS) and coercivity (HC) of the NPs were 70.3 emu g\u22121 and 398.4 Oe, respectively. The microporous Co/CoO/C NPs exhibited enhanced microwave absorption performance with a minimum reflection coefficient (RC) of \u221278.4 dB and a wide absorption bandwidth of 8.1 GHz (RC \u2264 \u221210 dB), larger than those of the nonporous counterparts of \u221268.3 dB and 5.8 GHz. The minimum RC values of the microporous Co/CoO/C NPs at different thicknesses were much smaller than the nonporous counterparts. The high microwave absorption mechanism of the microporous Co/CoO/C nanocomposite can be interpreted in terms of the interfacial polarization relaxation of the core/shell and micropore structures, the effective permittivity modification of the air in the micropores and the polarization relaxation of the defects in the low-graphitization carbon shell and the porous Co NPs. Our study demonstrates that the microporous Co/CoO/C nanocomposite is an efficient microwave absorber with high absorption intensity and wide absorption bandwidth.", "Assembled microspherical cathodes have attracted great attention thanks to their high tap density, good rate capability and cycling stability. However, for layered Li-rich transition-metal oxides (LROs), the preparation of uniformly assembled microspheres still faces many challenges due to harsh synthetic conditions and the nature of multiple metal elements. In this work, Li1.17Mn0.50Ni0.16Co0.17O2 assembled microspheres have been prepared by a new route tactfully combining a solvothermal process and a molten-salt method. The use of a solvothermal process is helpful for the preparation of precursors with assembled microspherical morphology, and the addition of complex salts (NaCl and KCl), can increase the uniformity of cation distribution. The product obtained at 800 \u00b0C delivers the best electrochemical performances among all samples. At a current density of 300 mA g\u22121, its initial discharge capacity is larger than 228 mA h g\u22121, corresponding to a capacity retention ratio of 86.8% after 200 cycles. Even if the current density increases to 2000 mA g\u22121, its discharge capacity is still as large as 156 mA h g\u22121. What's more, we discover the moving rate of Li-ions during the sintering process will affect the uniformity of Li2MnO3-like and LiMO2 components in LRO assembled microspheres. This discovery is helpful for the preparation of LRO assembled microspheres with excellent electrochemical performances.", "Due to rich structural features and promising thermoelectric performances, antimony-based Zintl compounds, such as AZn2Sb2 (A = alkaline earth elements or divalent rare earth elements), have attracted much attention for both fundamental analysis and thermoelectric applications. Polycrystalline samples of Ba1\u2212x\u2212yNaxSryZn2Sb2 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.1, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 0.1) were prepared by a solid-state reaction method and hot press sintering with the aim of achieving synergistic optimization of the power factor and thermal conductivity. Substitution of Ba by Na could achieve optimization of the carrier concentration, leading to an increase in the power factor to 10.46 \u03bcW cm\u22121 K\u22122 at 704 K for Ba0.94Na0.06Zn2Sb2 in comparison to pristine BaZn2Sb2 (5.39 \u03bcW cm\u22121 K\u22122 at 464 K). The introduction of Sr depressed the thermal conductivity by lattice disorder. Combining the two aforementioned effects, a higher ZT value of 0.58 at 704 K was obtained for Ba0.92Na0.06Sr0.02Zn2Sb2, which is greater than that for BaZn2Sb2 by 87% at the same temperature.", "Tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a layered semiconducting material with a tunable bandgap that is promising in next generation nanoelectronics as well as energy harvesting devices. In this study, we presented a continuous and wafer-scale uniform WS2 layer preparation technique through sulfurization of a RF-sputtered WO3 film. Various characterization techniques were employed in order to investigate the structural and physical properties of the WS2 films. It was observed that the thickness of WS2 films could be controlled by tuning the sputtering time. The fabricated WS2 transistors exhibited high mobility values of \u223c17 and 37\u201338 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and on/off ratios in the range of \u223c104 and 104\u2013105 for 80\u2013100 s-sputter time and 120\u2013140 sputter time, respectively, which is in the maximum range for CVD-grown WS2 FETs with an SiO2 gate oxide. Photoresponse was also studied for a few layers of WS2 on a transparent quartz substrate and it was observed that the photosensitivity was linearly dependent on bias voltage. The proposed growth technique is attractive for next-generation transparent and nanoelectronic devices, as well as for other potential applications.", "Controllable synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with tunable bandgaps is vital for their applications in nanophotonics, due to its efficient modulation of the physical and chemical properties of these atomic layered nanostructures. Here we report for the first time, the controllable synthesis of spatially composition-modulated WS2xSe2(1\u2212x) nanosheets and WS2\u2013WS2xSe2(1\u2212x) lateral heterostructures by a developed one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach, as well as the understanding of their growth mechanism. During the growth, the composition was optically tuned along the plane of the atomic layered nanosheets through the precise control of evaporation sources. Microstructure characterization confirms the chemical identity of the composition modulated nanosheets, with S and Se contents gradually converting from the center to the edge. Local photoluminescence (PL) and Raman studies further demonstrate the position-dependent optical properties of the as-grown nanosheets, with the PL peak and Raman modes shifting in a wide range along the whole plane of the nanostructures, which are consistent with their tunable compositions and bandgaps. This demonstration of composition-modulated nanostructures provides a beneficial approach for the preparation of 2D semiconductor heterostructures and may open up a wide range of applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.", "The effect of the catalyst morphology on the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNT) on nanostructured transition metal oxides was investigated to study a novel low-temperature synthetic route to functional CNT\u2013transition metal oxide nanocomposites. Among several nanostructured manganese oxides with various morphologies and structures, only exfoliated 2D nanosheets of layered MnO2 acted as an effective catalyst for the chemical vapor deposition of CNT at low temperatures of 400\u2013500 \u00b0C, which emphasizes the critical role of the catalyst morphology in CNT growth. Heat treatment of the MnO2 nanosheets under a C2H2 flow induced the deposition of CNT, as well as a phase transition to a 2D ordered assembly of MnO nanoparticles. The resulting CNT\u2013MnO nanocomposites displayed excellent functionalities in Li-ion electrodes with huge discharge capacities and good rate characteristics, which highlights the usefulness of the present method for studying functional CNT\u2013metal oxide nanocomposites. Electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations propose a formation mechanism via the efficient adsorption of carbon on the MnO2 nanosheets followed by the surface diffusion of carbon. It is of prime importance that the substitution of Fe for layered MnO2 nanosheets remarkably improved the efficiency of the formation of CNT by enhancing the surface adsorption of carbon species. This is the first report of the efficient growth of CNT at a very low temperature of 400 \u00b0C. The universal merit of the 2D nanosheet morphology was confirmed by the successful synthesis of a CNT\u2013TiO2 nanocomposite with exfoliated titanate nanosheets. The present study demonstrates that employing exfoliated transition metal oxide nanosheets as catalysts provides an efficient low-temperature synthetic route to functional CNT\u2013transition metal oxide nanocomposites.", "Colusite-based materials have attracted significant interest in the field of thermoelectrics because of their earth-abundant elements (Cu, S) and high thermoelectric performance. In this study, we demonstrate the enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT in colusites Cu26A2E6\u2212xS32 (A = Nb, Ta; E = Sn, Ge; x = 0, 0.5) by modifying their chemical composition. Colusite samples were prepared by melting a mixture of their constituent elements in evacuated quartz tubes followed by hot pressing. The electrical resistivity decreased with Sn and Ge contents, leading to an improvement in the power factor. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed cation-rich compositions in all the colusite samples. The extra cations were most likely formed during the sintering processes, and they effectively scattered heat-carrying phonons, yielding a low total thermal conductivity (<0.80 W K\u22121 m\u22121). For Cu26Ta2Sn6\u2212xS32, scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed the insertion of CuS- and Cu2S-based microscale precipitates, which further reduced the lattice thermal conductivity. At 670 K, a ZT of \u223c1.0 was achieved in Cu26Ta2Sn5.5S32, arising from a power factor of \u223c800 \u03bcW K\u22122 m\u22121. Moreover, the low total thermal conductivity (\u223c0.47 W K\u22121 m\u22121 at 670 K) in Cu26Nb2Ge6.0S32 leaded to a high ZT of \u223c1.0 at 670 K.", "Copper sulfide is a promising thermoelectric (TE) material consisting of earth-abundant, low cost, and non-toxic elements, which recently has attracted increasing attention. In this work, a series of single-phased Cu2S1\u2212xSex bulks were prepared by using mechanical alloying (MA) combined with spark plasma sintering (SPS). We found that Se doping could not only enhance the power factor (PF) of Cu2S by modifying the band structure, but also reduce the thermal conductivity (\u03ba) by generating point defects to intensify the phonon scattering. A peak ZT value of 0.74 was achieved at 723 K for the Cu2S0.9Se0.1 composition, resulting from a high PF = 260.5 \u03bcW m\u22121 K\u22122 and a low \u03ba = 0.25 W m\u22121 K\u22121, which is 131% higher than that (0.32) of the pristine Cu2S. Our results suggest that the TE properties of Cu2S can be greatly enhanced by simultaneously increasing PF and decreasing \u03ba via doping a sole Se element.", "La0.7Ca0.3 \u2212 xNaxMnO3 \u00b1 \u03b3 (LCNM) solid solutions with x = 0, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10 have been synthesized (rhombohedral structure, sp. gr. R$$\n\\overline 3 \n$$c). Sodium volatility during sintering is shown to lead to the formation of vacancies on the lanthanum and oxygen sites. Ca2+ \u2192 Na+ substitution does not increase the fraction of Mn4+ in LCNM, but the increase in the concentration of lanthanum vacancies with increasing sodium content leads to an increase in ferromagnetic ordering temperature TC and magnetoresistance, which depend, in addition, on heat-treatment conditions on account of the sodium volatility.", "The microstructure of ceramic samples of high-pressure ferroelectric LixNa1 \u2212 xNbO3 (x = 0.17, 0.25) perovskite solid solutions has been studied in relation to synthesis temperature and composition. The elastic properties (Young\u2019s modulus) of the high-pressure LixNa1 \u2212 xNbO3 (x = 0.125, 0.17, 0.25) solid solutions have been studied for the first time by a contact technique. The results demonstrate that, with increasing sintering temperature, the Young\u2019s modulus of the high-pressure LixNa1 \u2212 xNbO3 solid solutions at singular concentration points (xi = 0.125 and 0.25, Li/Na = 1/7 and 1/3) increases considerably, whereas that of Li0.17Na0.83NbO3 decreases markedly, which seems to be related to the recrystallization behavior of ordered and disordered solid solutions at high pressures.", "Co (Ni) films on ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PbZr0.45Ti0.55O3) ferroelectric substrates and single-crystal GaAs piezoelectric substrates are shown to exhibit a giant magnetoelectric response, which reaches 200 V/A at room temperature and mechanical Q of at least 1000. These findings are interpreted in terms of the formation of stable interfaces in thin-film heterostructures owing to good adhesion of dissimilar materials to substrate surfaces after ion beam sputtering/deposition processing. This will allow one to extend the applicability of the magnetoelectric effect at room temperature to commercially available microelectronic materials and integrate related hybrid structures into single-chip signal generation/processing devices.", "Py/Co1/Cu/Co2 films (Py is the Ni63Co25Fe12 ternary permalloy) were produced by magnetron sputtering on glass substrates. The thicknesses of layers are dCu = 0.7\u20134 nm, \n$$d_{Co_2 } $$\n = 2\u201312 nm, and dPy = 2\u201312 nm. The polar diagrams of the films with dCu = 1.2nm demonstrate a biaxial anisotropy, whereas the films with 2.0 \u2264 dCu \u2264 3.0 nm are characterized by uniaxial anisotropy. The first maximum in the \u0394\u03c1/\u03c1 = f(dCu) curve is due to an antiferromagnetic coupling between the Py/Co1 and Co2 layers; the second maximum is due to the independent magnetization reversal of the Py/Co1 soft magnetic bilayer and Co2 hard magnetic layer. The magnetoresistance measured along the EA exhibits an almost twofold increase with increasing thickness of ferromagnetic layers. The coercive force was shown to decrease with increasing thickness of the Co2 layer, whereas the magnetic anisotropy field is unchanged. The coercive force and induced magnetic anisotropy were estimated theoretically taking into account changes in the mean-square amplitude and roughness period with increasing thickness of the Co2 layer. The results obtained agree with experimental data.", "Magnetic properties and hyperfine interactions in the carbide Fe7C3 prepared by mechanical synthesis (MS) of \u03b1-Fe in toluene have been studied. It has been found that the boundary of temperature stability of the MS carbide does not exceed 775 K. The Curie temperature of the synthesized phase varies between 509 and 525 K. The M\u00f6ssbauer experiments (57Fe) have demonstrated that the unit cell of Fe7C3 contains 32 iron atoms distributed over five types of crystallographic positions with a multiplicity of 4: 8: 8: 8: 4. The hyperfine interaction parameters have been calculated for each nonequivalent position.

In these alloys, the band calculations predict the existence of a high degree of polarization of charge carriers. The chemical composition and the magnetic and structural characteristics of the films of both compounds have been studied. In the films of the Fe2NbSn alloy, which never has been investigated previously, we also studied optical and electrical properties. Based on the data obtained, we concluded that we obtained films with a composition close to stoichiometric. The annealing of the films leads to the appearance of a crystal structure and magnetic properties that correspond to the theoretical calculations. In the case of the Co2Cr0.6Fe0.4Al alloys, the structural and magnetic characteristics are identical to the literature data for the films obtained using continuous targets.", "Fe20Ni80 thin films, with a thickness of 0.7 \u03bcm, were sputtered onto Si (111) single crystal and 40-\u03bcm thick Ni79Fe21 ribbons were fabricated using the rapid solidification process (RSP). Annealing of Ni-Fe thin films and ribbons at various temperatures showed that the stress induced during the sample fabrication was relieved with a subsequent decrease in coercivity, which was determined from the measurements of magnetic properties using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Decrease in coercivity of Ni-Fe thin films and ribbons were strongly dependent on annealing temperatures. Also noted was a high correlation between residual stress reduction at different annealing temperatures and coercivity that magnetic properties are strongly influenced by residual stress induced in samples.", "Multilayer Gd\u2013Co/Co/Cu/Co structures were prepared by magnetron sputtering. An analysis of the magnetic and resistive properties allows us to classify these structures among spin valves which demonstrate the giant magnetoresistance effect.

The increase in y from 0 to 0.20 is accompanied by an increase in the Curie temperature from 327 to 492\u00b0C. This favors a decrease in the value of \u03b1 from 0.099 to 0.060%/\u00b0C, respectively. Magnets with an oxygen content of no more than 2500 ppm which were prepared from the (Nd0.75Dy0.25)13.9(Fe0.85Co0.15)79.8Cu0.1 Ga0.1B6.1 alloy, have the following hysteresis characteristics at 140\u00b0C: Br \u2265 11.3 kG, Hc \u2265 8 kOe, and (BH)max \u2265 30 MGOe; in this case, \u03b1 \u2264 |\u20130.07%/\u00b0\u0421|.", "Nanocrystalline Fe97 \u2212 xZr3Nx films produced by rf reactive magnetron sputtering onto rotating and stationary substrates are studied. X-ray diffraction analysis is used to study the structure of the as-sputtered and annealed (at 300\u2013600\u00b0C) films. The maximum saturation induction Bs reached for the films under study is 1.8\u20131.9 T; the minimum coercive force Hc is 1.5\u20131.8 Oe. These magnetic properties are explained using the structural state of the films.", "Materials (Pr1\u2212xDyx)12\u201317(Fe1\u2212yCoy)balB5\u201315 (x = 0.44\u20130.51 at %, y = 0.15\u20130.87 at %) have been studied. It is shown that the abrupt decrease in the coercive force of the (Pr1\u2212xDyx)12\u201317(Fe1\u2212yCoy)balB5-15 sintered materials with x = 0.44\u20130.51 and y > 0.25 is determined by the amount of boron-containing phases. In this case, an increase in the boron content in the (Pr0.72Dy0.28)14.5(Fe0.50Co0.50)balBz material with an unchanged dysprosium content leads to an increase in the coercive force by 4.5 times. It is assumed that the escape of boron from the near-surface areas of R2F14B-phase grains leads to the formation of regions characterized by a low anisotropy constant, which serve as nuclei for the formation of reverse-magnetization domains.", "It has been shown that the alloying of sintered Nd-Dy-Fe-Co-B magnets with praseodymium leads to an increase in their temperature stability at temperatures of 20\u2013100\u00b0C. This effect is explained by the redistribution of dysprosium ions in the crystal lattice of the base (Nd, Pr, Dy)2(Fe, Co)14B magnetic phase, namely, by their transition from 4f to 4g sites.", "The effect of the chromium concentration on the magnetic properties of Fe\u2013Cr precursors for hard-magnetic Fe\u2013Cr\u2013Co materials is studied. Nitrogen used as a sintering atmosphere and a long annealing time enhance are found to increase the coercive force Hc of the materials. The phase formation in Fe\u201330% Cr alloys is traced during heat treatment in nitrogen and argon atmosphere using thermal analysis.", "Solid-state thin-film lithium-ion battery of LiMn2O4/Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3/LiMn2O4 is prepared by spray technique using Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 sintered pellet as both electrolyte and substrate. The thin-film battery is heat-treated by rapid thermal annealing. Phase identification, morphology and electrochemical properties of the sintered pellets and thin-film battery are investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments, respectively. The results show that LiMn2O4 films with some pores are well deposited on the surface of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 sintered pellet. The discharge current density and temperature have considerable effect on discharge capacity of the thin-film battery. LiMn2O4/Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3/LiMn2O4 thin-film battery can be easily cycled with a capacity loss of 0.213% per cycle when 50 cycles are carried out.", "The radial distribution of the composition and thickness of lead zirconate titanate films deposited in several modes of magnetron and diode sputtering was measured. It was shown that the effects of deposited film resputtering with preferential lead sputtering are pronounced during ion-plasma sputtering of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3. During magnetron sputtering, this leads to a nonuniform distribution of the film composition over the substrate, which cannot be compensated by varying the target composition. During diode sputtering with a short target-substrate distance, resputtering has no significant effect on the film composition.", "The cathodoluminescence spectra of polycrystalline CVD ZnSxSe1\u2212x alloy layers grown with the Zn excess are investigated. The dependence Eg(x) is refined taking into account the location of exciton bands at 300 K. It is confirmed that the spectra are reconstructed on dissolving oxygen in the lattice under the effect of high pressures and temperatures of the gas-static treatment. The dependence of the self-activated emission on the alloy composition is observed for the accepted conditions of the gas-static treatment. For the compositions close to ZnSe (x < 0.5), the self-activated SAL band emerges. In contrast with this, only the short-wavelength shift of the SA band is observed for the compositions close to ZnS (x > 0.7), which is also most typical of the compounds themselves. These specific features are interpreted based on the calculations of the equilibrium of intrinsic point defects, which affect the location of the Fermi level under the deviation of ZnSe and ZnS from stoichiometry. The spectral regions, in which the bands of oxygen-containing SA and SAL complexes in the ZnSxSe1-x alloy can be observed, are evaluated. These regions depend on x and the oxygen concentration at the lattice sites. The behavior of exciton bands and infrared radiation emerging in the Cu (3d9) ions is investigated after the gas-static treatment. It is shown that the variation in the ensemble of intrinsic point defects during the gas-static treatment is determined by an increase in the number of defects with a smaller volume, specifically, the SSe antisite defects. The spectra are interpreted based on the theory of nonoverlapping bands, which are induced by the isoelectronic impurity.", "The influence of 0.63-\u03bcm laser radiation and an external electric field on the photo-and pyroelectric response of thin ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.54Ti0.46)O3 (PZT) films is studied at various temperatures. The films are grown by RF magnetron sputtering of a PZT ceramic target on platinum-coated substrates. It is found that the photosensitivity of PZT films increases after switching of the applied static electric field, as well as after an increase in temperature.", "The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of nanostructured BaTiO3 ceramics produced by the solid-phase method has been studied; before sintering, the synthesized charge is subjected to a severe action in Bridgman anvils in combination with shear deformation. It has been found that the ferroelectric transition is substantially smeared and the phase transition temperature decreases nonlinearly with increasing applied pressure. It has been shown that the defect structure plays a dominant role in the formation of physical properties of the ceramics.", "The characteristics of ferroelectric thin films of strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) and niobium-doped strontium bismuth tantalate (SBTN) deposited by radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates were investigated. For the formation of the structure of the ferroelectric material, the deposited films were subjected to a subsequent annealing at temperatures of 970\u20131070 K in an O2 atmosphere. The results of the X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that, in contrast to SBT films, in which the Aurivillius phase is formed only at annealing temperatures of 1050\u20131070 K, the formation of this phase in SBTN films is observed already at a temperature of 970 K. The dependences of the dielectric permittivity, remanent polarization, and coercive force of the SBT and SBTN films on the subsequent annealing conditions were determined. It was found that, upon doping of the SBT films with niobium, the remanent polarization increases by a factor of approximately three, the Curie temperature increases by 50 K, and the dielectric permittivity also increases. It was revealed that, in contrast to the SBT films, the polarization of the SBTN films is observed already at an annealing temperature of approximately 970 K. It was shown that the replacement of SBT films by SBTN films in the manufacture of high-density nonvolatile ferroelectric randomaccess memory (FeRAM) capacitor modules makes it possible to decrease the synthesis temperature from 1070 to 990\u20131000 K, which improves the compatibility with the planar technology of semiconductor devices. However, it turned out that an increase in the coercive field makes niobium-doped SBT films less attractive for the use in FeRAM.", "The influence of the bias voltage polarity Us on microstructure, crystallographic texture and magnetic properties has been investigated for Ni films with a thickness of \u224815\u2013420 nm, which are obtained via magnetron sputtering at a working gas pressure P corresponding to the collision-deficient flight mode of atoms of the sputtered target between the target and the substrate. The Ni(111)-textured films have been shown to form at Us \u2248\u2013100 V, whose microstructure and magnetic parameters are almost unchanged with a thickness. In contrast, the Ni(200) films are formed at Us \u2248 +100 V, whose magnetic properties and micro-structure depend significantly on the thickness d that manifests in a critical thickness d* \u2248 150 nm, when the structure of the film becomes inhomogeneous in the thickness, the remagnetization loops are changed from rectangular to supercritical with the formation of the band domain structure.", "Polycrystalline samples of SrFe2/3W1/3O3 (SFWO) ceramic were obtained by solid-phase reactions with subsequent sintering using conventional ceramic technology. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that at room temperature, the SFWO ceramic is single-phase and has a perovskite-type structure with tetragonal symmetry and parameters a = 3.941(9) \u00c5, c = 3.955(6) \u00c5, and c/a = 1.0035. In studying the magnetic properties and the M\u00f6ssbauer effect in SFWO ceramics, it is found that the material is a ferrimagnet, and the iron ions are only in the valence state of Fe3+. It is suggested that in the temperature range of T = 150\u2013210\u00b0C, a smeared phase transition from a cubic (paraelectric) phase to a tetragonal (ferroelectric) phase takes place in SFWO with decreasing temperature.", "The sensitivity of magnetic sensors based on the Giant Magneto-Impedance effect can be enhanced using high permeability materials with a well-defined but small transverse anisotropy. We describe an experimental study performed on multilayered, permalloy-based thin films deposited by sputtering under a magnetic field that produces a homogeneous uniaxial anisotropy in the plane of the film. Patterning of the deposit by photolithographic methods into strip-shaped samples (with their long direction perpendicular to the induced anisotropy) establishes a longitudinal shape anisotropy that competes with the transversal one induced at deposition. The combination and competition of the two mutually perpendicular uniaxial anisotropies result in an effective one with a reduced magnitude (the difference between both of them) in the transversal direction. As the strength of the shape anisotropy is determined by the relation between width and length of the stripe, the magnitude of the effective anisotropy can be conveniently modulated by adequately selecting the aspect ratio of the patterned sample. The hysteresis loops measured by Kerr effect magnetometry confirm that the effective transversal anisotropy field can be reduced from 5 to 1 Oe which should concomitantly increase the sensitivity of thin film magneto-impedance sensors.", "The photoelectrochemical properties of nitrogen-incorporated ZnO (ZnO:N) films prepared by reactive radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering were measured and compared with those of pure ZnO films. We find that nitrogen incorporation narrows the bandgap of ZnO and shifts the optical absorption into the visible light regions. We further find that the ZnO:N films provide considerable photoresponse in the long-wavelength regions up to above 600nm . As a result, the ZnO:N films exhibit higher photocurrents than pure ZnO films under visible light illumination. The obtained photocatalytic activity indicates that ZnO:N films are potential candidates for photoelectrochemical water splitting and N incorporation can be utilized to improve the conversion efficiency.", "Metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor structures with BiFeO3 as the ferroelectric layer and hafnium oxide (HfO2) as the insulator layer were fabricated and characterized. The size of memory window as a function of HfO2 thickness was discussed. From the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, it was suggested that the volatile bismuth loss reduces with increasing the addition of oxygen during sputtering. The leakage current with respect to the binding energies of Fe2+ and Fe3+ states due to oxygen vacancies was studied. The endurance property shows that there was no deterioration after 109 cycles with the oxygen-rich condition.", "In this paper, we report the room-temperature ferromagnetism (FM) of a pure SnO2 nanostructure with various morphologies synthesized by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and study the growth condition dependences of morphology and magnetic property. As the growth temperature is increased from 700 to 900\u00b0C , the average diameter of SnO2 nanowires (NW) increases from 20 to 60 nm, while magnetization decreases from 0.223 to 0.081 emu/g. However, morphology and FM are not sensitive to the argon flow rate during the CVD synthesis. Selected area electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that all the samples possess a typical rutile structure, and no other impurity phases are observed. The results demonstrate that the ferromagnetic properties of the samples are related to the morphology and exhibit an increment trend with the increasing surface-to-volume ratio. With a combined study of photoluminescence, our results reveal that the oxygen vacancies mainly at the surface of NW contribute to the FM of SnO2 nanostructures.", "Niobium-doped MgxZn1\u2212xO (Nb-MZO) mixed oxide films with high transmittance were successfully deposited on sapphire substrates through radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering using a 4-in ZnO/MgO/NbOx (75/20/5 wt%) target. In this study, the films were analyzed using Hall measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transparent performance measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD results showed two peaks: MgO2 (002)-wurtzite and MgxZn1\u2212xO (111)-cubic peaks. The Nb-MZO films exhibited high transparency, with transmittance exceeding 90% in the visible region and a sharp absorption edge in the ultraviolet (UV) region, implying that the MgO content in the Nb-MZO layer increased the bandgaps. These results indicate that Nb-MZO films are ideal for use as transparent contact layers in near-UV light-emitting diodes. Hall measurements and XPS results successfully demonstrated the p-type conductivity of the Nb-MZO films because of the composition of the N-Nb binding caused by annealing in nitrogen atmosphere.", "A \u03b3-Fe2O3 coated carbon nanotube (CNT) core-shell structure with dual magnetic and field emission properties was successfully fabricated by a simple one-step technique. The \u03b3-Fe2O3 shell is deposited on vertically aligned multi-walled CNTs by chemical vapor deposition using ferrocene as the precursor at process temperatures of 200, 400 and 600\u00b0C. At 400\u00b0C, the \u03b3-Fe2O3 shell formed a polycrystalline coating of polygonal nanoparticles on the CNTs. Enhanced field emission performance was observed with a threshold field of 4.7 V\u03bcm\u22121 compared to pristine CNTs at 5.6 V\u03bcm\u22121. Magnetic measurements revealed that the \u03b3-Fe2O3-CNT composites demonstrated ferrimagnetic behavior with high saturation magnetization of 52.3 emu/g and coercivity of 237 Oe at room temperature.", "Electrodeposition process was studied in order to obtain uniformly thick magnetic films which could be incorporated in magnetic microsensors and actuators. Ni and NiFe patterns of different dimensions were deposited by micromolding on a Cu/Ti seed layer sputtered on SiO2/Si (for NiFe) and glass (for Ni). In the case of NiFe deposit, a linear deposition rate was calculated by measuring the deposit thickness using mechanical profilometry. The optimum pattern composition for the fabrication of magnetic microdevices was 80 at.% of Ni, that was found by comparing the magnetic properties of the deposits obtained from different conditions. The deposits structure was also characterized. All the parameters were studied as a function of the current density so that by controlling the electrodeposition conditions the characteristics of the deposits could be controlled. NiFe films were integrated in multilayered magneto-impedance sensors. They present good adherence of the layers even after performing annealing at both 300\u00b0C and 500\u00b0C and sensor sensitivity reaches 1%/Oe.", "The effects of a diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating on a silicon monoxide\u2013graphite composite electrode are studied in order to improve the electrochemical characteristics of silicon monoxide anodes. The DLC is applied through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and identified by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microprobe analysis. DLC-coated silicon monoxide\u2013 graphite composite anode/LiCoO2 full-cells (CR2032) are then assembled in an argon-filled glove-box. The discharge capacity of the coated cell is 523 mA h g\u22121 at the first cycle and 409 mA h g\u22121 at the 100th cycle at a 0.5 C rate. The 100-cycle capacity retention is 78.2%, which is greater than that of the bare cell (52%). The improved electrochemical characteristics of the DLC-coated cell are determined through impedance, energy-dispersive X-ray, and scanning electron microscopy analyzes. Because the DLC has a high Young's modulus and chemical stability, the coated silicon monoxide\u2013 graphite composite maintains a high capacity during cycling.", "The etch characteristics of magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) materials for spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) using He inductively coupled plasma (ICP) were compared with the etch characteristics of ICP using Ar or CO/NH3 (1:3). The ICP etching using He showed a higher etch selectivity of CoFeB over W and a more anisotropic etch profile compared to the etching using Ar at similar etch rates. The sputter etch characteristics of CoFeB and W were also investigated using the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) simulation program. The results showed higher sputter etch selectivity of CoFeB over W in addition to narrower angular distribution of the sputtered atoms than those obtained using Ar. The etching of MTJ materials using CO/NH3 (1:3) ICP exhibited good MTJ etch characteristics comparable to He ICP, however, the MTJ etched using CO/NH3 (1:3) showed the lowest saturation magnetization (MS) measured by a vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM) possibly due to the sidewall oxidation of MTJ while the MS values of the MTJ etched using He and Ar are similar. It is found that, by etching the MTJ materials using He ICP with the ion energy near the hardmask sputter threshold energy, highly anisotropic etch profiles could be obtained without forming the sidewall redeposited materials and without significant degradation of magnetic properties.", "The dependence of electrical, optical, structural, and surface properties on the thickness of Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) thin films deposited on glass substrates by cylindrical rotating magnetron sputtering (CRMS) was investigated. The resistivity of the CMRS-grown GZO films gradually decreased from 7.4\u00d710\u22123 Ohm-cm to 4.9\u00d710\u22124 Ohm-cm with increasing its thickness, while the transparency of the GZO films in visible region were kept constant regardless of its thickness. Both x-ray diffraction and high resolution electron microscope examinations showed that the CMRS-grown GZO film has a strongly (002) preferred orientation with increasing thickness even though it was sputtered at low substrate temperature below 230\u00b0C. By using spectroscopic ellipsometry, we estimated accurately the dielectric function and band gap energy of the CRMS grown GZO film. Using absorption coefficient \u03b1 (= 4\u03c0k/\u03bb) and linear extrapolation method, the band gap energy of the CRMS grown GZO film was estimated to be 3.67 \u00b1 0.04 eV, which is independent of its thickness. However, we found that it gave erroneous thickness-dependence of band gap energy when we used the absorbance (= \u2013 ln(T)/d) derived from transmission rather than the absorption coefficient.", "High-quality Ca0.8Dy0.2MnO3 nano-powders were synthesized by the solution combustion process. The size of the synthesized Ca0.8Dy0.2MnO3 powders was approximately 23 nm. The green pellets were sintered at 1150-1300\u00b0C at a step size of 50\u00b0C. Sintered Ca0.8Dy0.2MnO3 bodies crystallized in the perovskite structure with an orthorhombic symmetry. The sintering temperature did not affect the Seebeck coefficient, but significantly affected the electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of Ca0.8Dy0.2MnO3 increased with increasing temperature, indicating a semiconducting behavior. The absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient gradually increased with an increase in temperature. The highest power factor (3.7 \u00d7 10-5 Wm-1 K-2 at 800\u00b0C) was obtained for Ca0.8Dy0.2MnO3 sintered at 1,250\u00b0C. In this study, we investigated the microstructure and thermoelectric properties of Ca0.8Dy0.2MnO3, depending on sintering temperature.", "Zinc sulfide [ZnS] thin films were deposited on glass substrates using radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The substrate temperature was varied in the range of 100\u00b0C to 400\u00b0C. The structural and optical properties of ZnS thin films were characterized with X-ray diffraction [XRD], field emission scanning electron microscopy [FESEM], energy dispersive analysis of X-rays and UV-visible transmission spectra. The XRD analyses indicate that ZnS films have zinc blende structures with (111) preferential orientation, whereas the diffraction patterns sharpen with the increase in substrate temperatures. The FESEM data also reveal that the films have nano-size grains with a grain size of approximately 69 nm. The films grown at 350\u00b0C exhibit a relatively high transmittance of 80% in the visible region, with an energy band gap of 3.79 eV. These results show that ZnS films are suitable for use as the buffer layer of the Cu(In, Ga)Se2 solar cells.", "ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) thin films exhibiting varying crystallographic features ((222)-epitaxially, (400)-epitaxially, and randomly oriented films) were grown on various substrates by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The type of substrate used profoundly affected the surface topography of the resulting ZFO films. The surface of the ZFO (222) epilayer was dense and exhibited small rectangular surface grains; however, the ZFO (400) epilayer exhibited small grooves. The surface of the randomly oriented ZFO thin film exhibited distinct three-dimensional island-like grains that demonstrated considerable surface roughness. Magnetization-temperature curves revealed that the ZFO thin films exhibited a spin-glass transition temperature of approximately 40\u00a0K. The crystallographic orientation of the ZFO thin films strongly affected magnetic anisotropy. The ZFO (222) epitaxy exhibited the strongest magnetic anisotropy, whereas the randomly oriented ZFO thin film exhibited no clear magnetic anisotropy.", "We here report a simple and efficient method to grow single-layer bismuth nanoparticles (BiNPs) with various sizes on glass substrates. Optimal conditions were found to be 200\u00b0C and 0.12\u00a0W/cm2 at a growth rate of 6\u00a0\u00c5/s, with the deposition time around 40\u00a0s. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were used to calculate the particle size distribution statistics, and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to examine the chemical interactions between BiNPs and the substrates. By measuring the transmission spectra within the range of 300 to 1,000\u00a0nm, we found that the optical bandgap can be modulated from 0.45 to 2.63\u00a0eV by controlling the size of these BiNPs. These interesting discoveries offer an insight to explore the dynamic nature of nanoparticles.", "Selective laser sintering (SLS) process was used to prepare nanostructured porous 3D items consisting of Ni or/and Cu nanoclusters embedded into a polycarbonate (PC) matrix for potential use in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). Liquid-phase SLS was performed (in air or Ar) with the Ni-PC powder mixtures taken in proportions of 1 : 1, 1 : 2 (Ni particle size 27\u2013184 nm) and Cu-PC powder mixtures (1 : 9, 1 : 4, 3 : 7, Cu particle size 76\u201390 nm) using a cw YAG : Nd+3 laser (P = 4\u201310 W) and a scanned spot of slightly defocused beam. After sintering, the size of starting nanoparticles remained unaffected. Demonstrated was the feasibility of SLS production of functionally graded 3D items, which opens up a way to direct synthesis of NEMS devices. Process conditions for preparation of monolayers and 3D items were optimized. Functionally graded 3D items with alternating ferromagnetic Ni-PC and non-magnetic Cu-PC layers exhibited interesting electrophysical and magnetic properties.", "We investigated the influence of mechanical activation (MA) and initial temperature T0 on combustion temperature Tc and burning velocity Uc for 90% (Si + C)\u201310% (4B + C) mixtures as well as on product morphology. Mechanical activation was found to strongly change the size and morphology of Si and graphite particles (by a factor of 6\u20138), lead to accumulation of micro strains, and increase the reactivity of green mixture. An increase in T0 was found to proportionally increase the values of Tc and Uc but produce little or no influence on the phase composition of product. The SiC powder consisting of 50\u2013100 nm crystallites was obtained by diminution of combustion product and then used to prepare, by hot pressing, a ceramic PVD target for magnetron sputtering.", "Silver is known to be a highly mobile (low-soluble) component in Ag-doped perovskite manganites and hence several non-perovskite phases can exist in silver doped manganite perovskites with most synthetic routes making its synthesis to be problematic. In search of soft synthesis route, the low temperature combustion synthesis and magneto-structural studies of polycrystalline La1\u2013xAgyMnO3 (y \u2264 x) ceramic manganites using glycine as a fuel is reported. The sintered powders were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDAX) analysis, Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Vibrating Scanning Magnetometer (VSM) measurements. XRD patterns showed formation of mainly single rhombohedral perovskite phase for the La0.8Ag0.15MnO3 sample and an admixture of secondary phases with La0.8Ag0.1MnO3 and La0.8Ag0.2MnO3 samples. The distinct microstructure and higher magnetic properties observed for La0.8Ag0.15MnO3 sample compared to the other samples were discussed based on the XRD results.", "The effect of hot pressing conditions on the characteristics of the crystalline and magnetic structures of Cr-doped lanthanum-strontium manganites has been investigated for the first time using X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, magneto-optical visualization of magnetic flux, ferromagnetic resonance, and magnetic measurements. It is shown that application of pressure during sintering affects the concentration of differentvalence ions and structural vacancies and phase separation in the manganites studied.", "In this study, the thermoelectric properties of the Ag-doped Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 compounds were investigated in the temperature range from 323 K to 573 K. Ingots were fabricated by a conventional melting process and the powder crushed from ingots was then sintered using a hot-pressing method. The temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity of the Ag-doped Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 compound are characteristic of degenerate semiconductors, which is fairly different from the conventional Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 compound. The power factor (\u03b12\u03c3) of the quaternary compound was larger than that of the ternary, which is mainly due to the increase in the electrical conductivity with doping content of Ag. The thermal conductivity was greater than that of the Ag-free Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 compound in the temperature range from 323 K to 523 K. The lattice thermal conductivity showed low values throughout the temperature range. The maximum value of the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of the 0.05 wt. % Ag-doped compound and the ternary alloy were 1.2 at 373 K and 0.88 at 323 K, respectively. Each of the maximum peak ZT shifts to a higher temperature region with increases in the doping content of Ag. This is likely due to the control of the lattice thermal conductivity by the twin structure, which had a nano-ordered layer."]
