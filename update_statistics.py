"""
Generates the data for showing database statistics (preventing redundant
rester calls and prevent having to do caching nonsense).

Output: /zmbWeb/assets/data/db_statistics.json

To be run by either:
(a) The server host upon deployment (e.g., Heroku postdeploy)
(b) You, the developer, if you haven't set up automatic script running on
    deployments OR you just want to run it locally.
